The '''Gunpowder Incident''' (or '''Gunpowder Affair''') was a conflict early in the [[American Revolutionary War]] between [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], the Royal Governor of the [[Colony of Virginia]], and [[militia]] led by [[Patrick Henry]]. On April 20, 1775, one day after the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] (and well before news of that event reached Virginia), Lord Dunmore ordered the removal of the [[gunpowder]] from the [[gunpowder magazine|magazine]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] to a [[Royal Navy]] ship.

This action sparked local unrest, and militia companies began mustering throughout the colony.  [[Patrick Henry]] led a small militia force toward Williamsburg to force return of the gunpowder to the colony's control.  The matter was resolved without conflict when a payment of [[Pound sterling|£]]330 was made to Henry.  Dunmore, fearing for his personal safety, later retreated to a naval vessel, ending royal control of the colony.

==Background==
Military tensions began to rise in the [[Thirteen Colonies|British colonies of North America]] in 1774 when a series of legislative acts by the British Parliament known as the [[Intolerable Acts]] began to be implemented in the colonies.  The colonies, in solidarity with the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], which had been singled out for punishment by those acts in the wake of the [[Boston Tea Party]], had organized a Congress to meet in September 1774.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;  During the meeting of the [[First Continental Congress]] word arrived of a militia uprising in Massachusetts that became known as the [[Powder Alarm]].  In early September, General [[Thomas Gage]], the royal governor of Massachusetts, had removed gunpowder from a powder magazine in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] (in a location now in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]]), and militia from all over [[New England]] had flocked to the area in response to false rumors that violence had been involved.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=R48&gt;Russell, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  One consequence of this action was that the Congress called for the colonies to organize militia companies for their defense.&lt;ref name=R48/&gt;  Another was that [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Lord Dartmouth]], the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], advised the colonial governors to secure their military supplies, and prohibited importation of further supplies of powder.&lt;ref name=SH1/&gt;

In early 1775, Virginians began to organize militia companies and seek out military supplies (weapons, ammunition, and gunpowder) to arm and equip them.  [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]]'s royal governor, saw this rising unrest in his colony and sought to deprive Virginia militia of these supplies.&lt;ref name=SH1&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not until after [[Patrick Henry]]'s &quot;[[Give me liberty or give me death]]&quot; speech at the [[Second Virginia Convention]] on March 23 that Dunmore &quot;[thought] it prudent to remove some Gunpowder which was in a Magazine in this place.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Although British Army troops had been withdrawn from Virginia in the wake of the Powder Alarm, there were several Royal Navy ships in the Virginia waters of [[Chesapeake Bay]].  On April 19, Lord Dunmore quietly brought a company of British sailors into [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] and quartered them in the governor's mansion.  Dunmore then ordered Captain [[Henry Collins (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Collins]], commander of [[HMS Magdalen|HMS ''Magdalen'']], to remove the gunpowder from the magazine in Williamsburg.&lt;ref name=R52/&gt;

==Removing the gunpowder==
[[File:Williamsburg magazine drawing exterior.gif|thumb|right|Drawing of the octagonal Williamsburg Magazine]]&lt;!--this illustration seems redundant, as it does not date from the 18th century, and there is a photo of the same building in this article--&gt;
On the night of April 20, Royal Navy sailors went to the Williamsburg powder magazine, loaded fifteen half barrels of powder into the governor's wagon, and transported it to the eastern end of the [[Quarterpath Road]] to be loaded aboard the ''Magdalen'' in the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]].  The act was discovered by townsfolk while underway, and they sounded an alarm. Local militia rallied to the scene, and riders spread word of the incident across the colony.  Dunmore had as a precaution armed his servants with muskets, and it was only the calming words of Patriot leaders, including the Speaker of the [[Virginia House of Burgesses|House of Burgesses]], [[Peyton Randolph]], that prevented the assembling crowd from storming Dunmore's mansion.&lt;ref name=R52&gt;Russell, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  The city council demanded the return of the powder, claiming it was the property of the colony and not [[the Crown]].  Dunmore demurred, stating that he was moving the powder as protection against its seizure during a rumored slave uprising, and would eventually return it.  This seemed to satisfy the assembled crowd, and it dispersed peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Unrest however persisted in Williamsburg and spread throughout the countryside.  After a second crowd was convinced to disperse by Patriot leaders, Dunmore reacted angrily, warning on April 22 that if attacked, he would &quot;declare Freedom to the Slaves, and reduce the City of Williamsburg to Ashes.&quot;&lt;ref name=R52/&gt; He also told a Williamsburg [[alderman]] that he had &quot;once fought for the Virginians&quot; but &quot;By God, I would let them see that I could fight against them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Patrick henry.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.5|[[Patrick Henry]], portrait by George Bagby Matthews c. 1891 after an original by [[Thomas Sully]]]]
By April 29, militia mobilizing in the countryside had learned of the battles at Lexington and Concord.  Nearly 700 men mustered at [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], and decided to send a messenger to Williamsburg to assess the situation before marching on the capital.  Peyton Randolph advised against violence, and [[George Washington]], a longtime leader of the Virginia militia, concurred.  In response to their advice, the Fredericksburg militia voted by a narrow margin not to march.&lt;ref name=R53&gt;Russell, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  However, militia from other parts of the colony did march to Williamsburg.  The [[Hanover County, Virginia|Hanover County]] militia, led by Patrick Henry, voted on May 2 to march on Williamsburg.  Henry dispatched a small company to the home of Richard Corbin, who was the Deputy Collector of the Royal Revenue in Virginia, in a bid to force him to pay for the powder from Crown revenue in his possession;  the remainder of the Hanover County militia, numbering about 150, marched toward Williamsburg, arriving about {{convert|15|mi|km}} away on May 3.&lt;ref name=SB4/&gt;  That day Dunmore's family escaped Williamsburg to [[Porto Bello (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Porto Bello]], Lord Dunmore's hunting lodge on the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]], and from there to {{HMS|Fowey|1749|6}}, lying at anchor in the York River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Numerous Errors in Wilstach's 'Tidewater Virginia' Challenge Criticism |last= Kibler |first=J. Luther |journal=[[William and Mary Quarterly]] | series =  2nd Ser. |volume=11 |issue=2 |date=April 1931 |pages=152–156 |doi=10.2307/1921010 |publisher=Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture |jstor=1921010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corbin was not at home&amp;mdash;he was in Williamsburg, meeting with Dunmore.&lt;ref name=SB4&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry was advised by [[Carter Braxton]], Corbin's son-in-law and a Patriot member of the House of Burgesses, not to enter the city, while Braxton rode into the city and negotiated a payment.&lt;ref name=SB5/&gt;  The next day, May 4, Henry received a [[bill of exchange]] for £330 signed by a wealthy plantation owner, as payment for the powder (he refused the offer of payment from Crown accounts).&lt;ref name=R53/&gt;  Henry then departed to take his place as a member of Virginia's delegation to the [[Second Continental Congress]], promising to deliver the money to &quot;the Virginia Delegates at the General congress&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 6 Dunmore issued a proclamation charging Henry with extortion of the £330, and forbidding the citizenry to assist Henry in any way.&lt;ref name=R53/&gt;  Henry was offered protection by several counties, and was escorted by several companies of militia to the Maryland border as he made his way to [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=SB5&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Sir Joshua Reynolds - John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|Portrait of Dunmore by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], 1765]]
The incident burnished Henry's reputation while worsening Dunmore's popularity.&lt;ref name=SB5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Although his family briefly returned to Williamsburg on May 12 as a sign of good faith, relations between Dunmore and the House of Burgesses continued to deteriorate.  On June 8, Dunmore and his family fled the [[Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Governor's Palace]] in the middle of the night and took up residence aboard ''Fowey''.&lt;ref&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, pp. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt;  The Burgesses had been deliberating the [[Conciliatory Resolution]], a proposal that was an attempt by the [[North Ministry]] to divide the colonies.  In the wake of Dunmore's flight, the Burgesses rejected the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunmore continued to make vigorous attempts to regain control of the colony, but after a decisive defeat of British forces [[Battle of Great Bridge|at Great Bridge]] in December, he was reduced to raiding operations and eventually abandoned the colony for good in August 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 68–76&lt;/ref&gt;  Virginia's government was first taken over by a [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]], chosen by the [[Third Virginia Convention]] in July 1775; Patrick Henry became the independent state's first [[Governor of Virginia|governor]] in July 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Selby and Higginbotham, pp. 52,121&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a '''Moishezon manifold''' {{mvar|M}} is a compact [[complex manifold]] such that the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[meromorphic function]]s on each component {{mvar|M}} has [[transcendence degree]] equal the [[complex dimension]] of the component:

:&lt;math&gt;\dim_\mathbf{C}M=a(M)=\operatorname{tr.deg.}_\mathbf{C}\mathbf{C}(M).&lt;/math&gt;

Complex [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] have this property, but the converse is not true: [[Hironaka's example]] gives a smooth 3-dimensional Moishezon manifold that is not an algebraic variety or [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]].  {{harvs|txt|last=Moishezon|year=1966|loc=Chapter I, Theorem 11|authorlink=Boris Moishezon}} showed that a Moishezon manifold is a [[projective algebraic variety]] if and only if it admits a [[Kähler metric]]. {{harvtxt|Artin|1970}} showed that any Moishezon manifold carries an [[algebraic space]] structure; more precisely, the category of Moishezon spaces (similar to Moishezon manifolds, but are allowed to have singularities) is equivalent with the category of algebraic spaces that are proper over {{math|Spec('''C''')}}.

'''Matthew Diamond Lagan''' (June 20, 1829 in [[Maghera]], [[County Londonderry]], [[Ireland]] – April 8, 1901 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]) was a [[U.S. Representative]] from [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]] from 1887 to 1889 and 1891 to 1893. He was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].

Lagan immigrated to the United States at age 14.  In New Orleans, he fitted out vessels for the [[Confederate Navy]], and served in the Confederate Navy himself.  He was elected to terms on the New Orleans City Council in 1867 and 1882.  After serving his first term in Congress, he chose not to run for reelection, but then ran in 1890 and defeated his successor, [[Hamilton D. Coleman]].

Lagan died in 1901 and is buried in [[Metairie Cemetery]].

'''Plan International USA''' is an international [[charitable organization|charity]] with offices in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. It is part of [[Plan International]], a global non-profit organization. The stated goal of the organization is to end the [[cycle of poverty]] for children by working side by side with local communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.planusa.org/what-we-do, Plan International USA, What We Do]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development==
{{Main|Plan International}}

Plan was founded in 1937 by British journalist [[John Langdon-Davies]] and refugee worker Eric Muggeridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;universal&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.universalgiving.org/donate/plan_international_usa_former/id567.do Plan International USA (formerly Childreach)]&quot; summary on Universal Giving page (accessed Oct. 9 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Originally named &quot;Foster Parents Plan for Children in Spain,&quot; the aim was to provide food, accommodation and education to children whose lives had been disrupted by the [[Spanish Civil War]]. During the [[Second World War]], under the name &quot;Foster Parents Plan for War Children,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uri.edu/library/special_collections/registers/manuscripts/msg223.xml Foster Parent’s Plan for War Children  Letters 1942-1997], University of Rhode Island Special collections page accessed Oct. 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the organization expanded to work with displaced children throughout war-torn Europe. By the 1970s, Plan gradually began working with children throughout Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. 1970s

Plan International USA, was originally [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] as &quot;Foster Parents Plan, Inc.,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plan International USA, [http://www.planusa.org/content2714575 Celebrating our 75th Anniversary] (accessed Oct. 9 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1939 in [[New York (state)|New York]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbn.com/Involving-communities-key-to-Plan-USA-success-abroad,54449 &quot;Involving communities key to Plan USA success abroad,&quot; ''Providence Business News'']&lt;/ref&gt; to help connect U.S. donors to a continuously growing number of sponsored children in developing countries. It was one of the first Plan International federation members. By 2010, Plan's donor countries had increased to 21.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planusa.org/who_where/who_where.php Plan USA Where We Work]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name Change===
In 1974, the international parent organization Foster Parents Plan shortened its name to become simply Plan International.&lt;ref name=&quot;canada&quot;&gt;[http://plancanada.ca/ForSponsors/PlansStory Plan's Story] (accessed Oct. 9 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s the U.S. organization followed suit, with a name change to &quot;Childreach/Plan International&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;universal&quot; /&gt; to avoid the program confused with local [[foster care]] programs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lippincott.com/work/childreach/ Lippincott Brand Strategy and Design, &quot;Childreach&quot;] (accessed Oct. 9 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and then simply to &quot;Plan International USA&quot;.

== Finances ==
Plan International USA is a publicly funded American non-profit charitable organization, deriving its income from a combination of individual contributions and private and [[federal grants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbn.com/detail.html?sub_id=545fbc8f5ec4&amp;page=3 Overseas spending by nonprofit a boost to U.S. security | Providence Business News]&lt;/ref&gt; It is exempt from both United States federal and Rhode Island state income tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://give.org/charity-reviews/national/relief-and-development/plan-international-usa-in-warwick-ri-2809|title=Charity Report - Plan International USA - give.org|website=give.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total operating revenue in 2010 for the organization was approximately $63&amp;nbsp;million. 77% of the organization's funding was reported to go to programs, while 23% was reported as support for programming through fundraising and administrative expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://give.org/charity-reviews/national/relief-and-development/plan-international-usa-in-warwick-ri-2809|title=Charity Report - Plan International USA - give.org|website=give.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

'''Kraton'''  is the trade name given to a number of high performance [[elastomer]]s manufactured by [[Kraton Polymers]] ({{nyse|KRA}}), and used as [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] replacements for [[rubber]].  Kraton polymers offers many of the properties of natural rubber, such as flexibility, high traction, and sealing abilities, but with increased resistance to heat, weathering, and chemicals. It was first made by the chemical division of the [[Shell Oil Company]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://kraton.com/about/message.php |title=CEO's message |publisher=Kraton Polymers |accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the technical leadership of Murray Luftglass and [[Norman R.

==Properties==
[[File:Sbs block copolymer.jpg|thumb|Sbs block copolymer in [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]]]

Kraton polymers are styrenic [[block copolymer]] (SBC) consisting of [[polystyrene]] blocks and rubber blocks. The rubber blocks consist of [[polybutadiene]], [[polyisoprene]] or their hydrogenated equivalents. The tri-block with polystyrene blocks at both extremities linked together by a rubber block is the most important polymer structure observed in SBC. If the rubber block consist of polybutadiene, the corresponding triblock structure is: poly(styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) usually abbreviated as SBS. Kraton D (SBS and SIS) and their selectively hydrogenated versions Kraton G (SEBS and SEPS) are the major Kraton polymer structures. The microstructure of SBS consists of domains of polystyrene arranged regularly in a matrix of polybutadiene, as shown in the [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] micrograph. The picture was obtained on a thin film of polymer cast onto [[mercury (element)|mercury]] from solution, and then stained with [[osmium tetroxide]].

The [[glass transition temperature]] (T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) of the polybutadiene blocks is typically −90°C and T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; of the polystyrene blocks is +100°C. So, at any temperature between about −90°C and +100°C Kraton SBS will act as a physically crosslinked [[elastomer]]. If Kraton polymers are heated substantially above the T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; of the styrene-derived blocks, that is, above about 100°C, like 170°C the physical [[cross-links]] change from rigid [[glass]]y regions to flowable melt regions and the entire material flows and therefore can be cast, molded, or extruded into any desired form. On cooling, this new form resumes its elastomeric character. This is the reason such a material is called a  [[thermoplastic elastomer]] (TPE). The polystyrene blocks form domains of [[nanometre]] size in the microstructure, and they stabilise the form of the moulded material. Depending on the rubber to polystyrene ratio in the material, the polystyrene domains can be spherical or form cylinders or [[lamella (materials)|lamella]]e. The hydrogenated Kraton polymers named Kraton G exhibit improved resistance to temperature (processing at 200&amp;ndash;230°C is common), to oxidation and to UV. SEBS and SEPS due to their polyolefinic rubber nature present excellent compatibility with polyolefins and paraffinic oils.

== Applications ==
Kraton polymers are always used in blends with various other ingredients like paraffinic oils, polyolefins, polystyrene, bitumen, tackifying resins, fillers to provide a very large range of end-use products ranging from hot melt adhesives to impact modified transparent polypropylene bins, from medical TPE compounds to modified bitumen roofing felts or from oil gel toys (including sex toys) to elastic attachments in diapers. 

It can make [[asphalt]] flexible, which is necessary if the asphalt is to be used to coat a surface that is below grade or for highly demanding paving applications like F1 racing tracks. 

Kraton based compounds are also used in non-slip knife handles.

The earliest commercial components using Kraton G (thermoplastic rubber) in the automobile industry were in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LyLKf38zut0C&amp;pg=PT39&amp;dq=Kraton+Polymers+automobile |title=Thermoplastic elastomers II: Processing for performance: Papers from a one-day seminar, Volume 2 |publisher=iSmithers Rapra Technology |year=1989 |isbn=9780902348417 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Motors]] (AMC) used this polymer plastic on the [[AMC Eagle]] for the color matched flexible wheel arch flares that flowed into rocker panel extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=r9j7MWLE_jMC&amp;pg=PA270&amp;dq=AMC+Eagle+plastic+polymer+material+Kraton |title=The Cars of American Motors: An Illustrated History |first=Marc|last=Cranswick |publisher=McFarland |year=2012 |page=270 |isbn=978-0-7864-4672-8 |quote=A plastic polymer material bearing the trademark name &quot;Kraton&quot; was used for the wheel well extenders, rocker moldings and lower door panel protectors. |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some grades of Kraton can also be dissolved into hydrocarbon oils to create &quot;shear thinning&quot; grease type products that are used in the manufacture of telecommunications cables containing optical fibres.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Dany Toussaint''' was a candidate in the [[2006 Haitian elections|February 2006 presidential election]] in [[Haiti]]. Toussaint is a former [[Haitian Army]] major, police chief and bodyguard of [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]. He is a former Senator and leader of the [[Haitian Democratic and Reformist Movement Party]].

==Investigation==
In 2003, Judge Claudy Gassant requested that Toussaint's immunity from prosecution be lifted in regards to the assassination of Haitian journalist [[Jean Dominique]] who had accused Toussaint of having his rival for the position of Secretary of State for Public Security, Jean Lamy, assassinated. The request of Judge Gassant was rejected by the senate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=6197 Reporters Sans Frontières]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v25oEgZZ?url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=6197 |date=December 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bernard's Watch''''' (informally known as '''''Bernard''''' in the final series) is a British children's drama series about a young boy who could stop time with a magical [[pocket watch]]. The show was created by [[Andrew Norriss]] and was produced for seven series that aired on [[CITV]] from 14 November 1997 to 31 March 2005.

==History==
The concept of the show originally formed the basis of one of the most famous episodes of [[The Twilight Zone]], entitled [[A Kind of a Stopwatch]], first broadcast in 1963. In 1991, Alexander John Howard conceived of a series based on the same concept but it took six years to get funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;AN&quot; /&gt; The show eventually began as a single 15-minute episode, however it was suggested it could work as a series. Four more stories were written by creator [[Andrew Norriss]], who thought, in his own words, &quot;that would be it&quot;. However he ended up writing six series.

The original series aired from 14 November 1997 to 7 December 2001 and was produced by [[ITV Central|Central Television]]. It was written by Andrew Norris,&lt;ref name=&quot;AN&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.andrewnorriss.co.uk | title=The Website of Andrew Norriss}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote the book Bernard's Watch, a novelization based on the first three series, in 1999 which was published by Puffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.andrewnorriss.co.uk/bernardswatchtv.html | title=Bernard's Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.andrewnorriss.co.uk/bernardswatch.html | title=Bernard's Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was primarily filmed at [[South Wilford CofE Primary School]], [[Nottingham]]. These series were produced by Lewis Rudd&lt;ref&gt;https://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0748616&lt;/ref&gt; and directed by David Cobham.&lt;ref&gt;https://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0167886&lt;/ref&gt;

A couple of years after its original run, the show was revived for two more series and included a change to the format, new cast and filming location. The first of the new series was produced by [[Carlton Television]] and aired from 6 January to 30 March 2004. The second of the new series and the seventh and final of the show overall, renamed as 'Bernard', was produced by [[Granada Yorkshire]] and aired from 6 January to 31 March 2005. The school scenes were filmed at Kerr Mackie Primary School, [[Leeds]].

==Synopsis==

===Original series (1997-2001)===
The first run told of a young boy called Bernard, played by David Peachey, from Oakwood, Nottinghamshire, who was always late, until a [[postman]] gave him a &quot;magic watch&quot; which could stop and rewind time. He soon found out that the postman had magical powers, and that these watches were given to people who needed them. The rules of him keeping his watch were that he must not use it to commit crimes or hurt anyone. Every episode focused on Bernard or someone to whom he'd lent the watch facing a problem or simply doing day-to-day things and trying to sort them out, using the watch.

===New series (2004-2005)===
The second run was significantly different. According to the final opening sequence, the watch simply flew through Bernard's window. The character of the &quot;postman&quot; did not exist, and Bernard seemed to be the only person in the world who had such a watch. His best friend Nathan knew about the watch. This series revolved mainly around Bernard's school, Pentup Primary, where he'd usually get the better of his bullying schoolteacher Ms Yvonne Savage and a popular girl called Nicolette. By this series, David Peachey moved on from his portrayal of Bernard; he has since moved on from a career in acting and was studying art in Venice. {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Novel===
As well as the TV series, Andrew Norris also wrote a novel based on the series in 1999. In the context of the novel, Bernard received the watch from an elderly aunt, who had received it from her husband who got it from an old friend, although they never knew where the friend had acquired the watch as by the time he passed it on he had suffered a stroke and couldn't speak. Unlike in the TV show where using the watch was harmless, the watch has a subtle side-effect on the user in that it uses up the iron in their blood, requiring regular users to consume iron vitamins on a regular basis, causing Bernard to collapse when he avoids taking the iron-tainted drink provided by his aunt because he didn't like the taste and was unaware of the side-effects of the watch. On a personal note, Bernard is only living with his father, as his mother died before the events of the novel, and Karen is also shown as only having one parent. At the novel's conclusion, the watch is briefly stolen by a woman who once worked as a housekeeper for Bernard's aunt, but she is captured when the watch runs down and she tries to threaten Bernard for the key. Ill at various points throughout the book, Bernard's aunt dies in the penultimate chapter, but her spirit appears to him after her death to tell him that the true purpose of the watch is for 'learning'. In the final chapter, Bernard uses the watch key on a chain his aunt gave him to wind it back up, Bernard and Karen enjoying the restoration of the Watch as Bernard concludes that he has time to learn what she meant by that comment.

'''''Deep Trouble''''' is a [[BBC]] [[radio]] [[comedy]] series, written by and starring [[Jim Field Smith]] and [[Ben Willbond]], which first aired on BBC Radio 4 in October 2005. 

It takes place in the year 2012, aboard HMS ''Goliath'', a [[Royal Navy]] stealth nuclear [[submarine]], and follows the trials and tribulations of the submarine's chaotic crew, underneath their inept commanding officer, Captain Paul Wade (played by [[Jim Field Smith]]) and his officers Lieutenant Trainor, Weapons Officer (played by [[Ben Willbond]]), Commander Alison Fairbanks, second-in-command (played by [[Katherine Jakeways]]).  The series has also included a fourth regular character - in season one only this was  Petty Officer Lucy Radcliffe (played by [[Miranda Raison]]) and in season two this was Alice Barry, Computer and Weapons Expert (played by [[Alice Lowe]]).

The series parodies several features of the submarine genre established by ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' and ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'' and as such its announcer is a version of [[Tom Clancy]].

Series One started on Thursday 20 October 2005, and the series contains four episodes in total: &quot;Startled Deer&quot;, &quot;Special Relationship&quot;, &quot;Prize Hamper&quot;, and &quot;Crispy Duck&quot;. 

Series Two started on Thursday 24 May 2007.

Writing for ''[[The Times]]'', Chris Campling compared the programme favourably to the famous Naval radio sitcom ''[[The Navy Lark]]'' and called ''Deep Trouble'' &quot;hilarious&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Radio head |author= Chris Campling |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1794502.ece |newspaper= The Times |date= 19 May 2007 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also selected as a 'Pick of the Day' by Phil Daoust of [[the Guardian]] on 24 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Pick of the day |author= Phil Daoust |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/24/tvandradio.radio |newspaper= The Guardian |date= 24 May 2007 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The series was produced and directed by [[David Tyler (UK)|David Tyler]] at [[Pozzitive Television]] for [[BBC Radio 4]].

The '''Hotel Charlottetown''' was a hotel built in 1931 in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]] by the [[Canadian National Railway]] (through their lodging division, [[Canadian National Hotels]]).

Its most notable guests were Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] who stayed at the hotel during Prince Edward Island's centennial [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] celebrations in July 1973.

[[Canadian National Hotels]] sold the property to [[Rodd Hotels and Resorts]] in the early 1980s.  Since then, the hotel has operated as the '''Rodd Charlottetown''', also known informally as the '''Charlottetown Hotel'''.  Rodd funded a renovation and restoration project in 1999.

Lorimer studied the trumpet at the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland|Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]] in Glasgow.  His classical music background can be heard quite distinctively in his work for The Waterboys' single &quot;[[The Whole of the Moon]]&quot;, which later turned out to be the band's greatest commercial success. Lorimer includes another Waterboys recording, an arrangement of [[W. B. Yeats]]' poem &quot;[[The Stolen Child]]&quot;, amongst his top ten favourite recordings of all time{{Ref|KHbio}}.

Roddy Lorimer, as part of the Kick Horns, toured the North America and the UK with The Who in 1989. World tours with Eric Clapton in 1993-96 and later a European tour for six months with the Clapton Band in 2006. He was a member of [[Pete Townshend]]'s '[[Deep End (band)|Deep End]]' (1985), a short-lived supergroup founded by Townshend featuring [[Pink Floyd]] guitarist [[David Gilmour]]. The group also included drummer [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]], bassist [[Chucho Merchan]], percussionist [[Jody Linscott]], keyboardist [[John Bundrick|John 'Rabbit' Bundrick]], harmonica player [[Peter Hope Evans]], vocalists [[Billy Nicholls]], [[Cleveland Watkiss]], and [[Chyna (singer)|Chyna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mabbett-3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Omnibus | isbn = 9781849383707 | last = Mabbett | first = Andy | title = Pink Floyd – The Music and the Mystery | location = London | date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,176653,00.html Artist Direct listing]&lt;/ref&gt;

He toured extensively through the 80' and early 90's with The Waterboys. Currently he is playing with Cotton Mouth, one of [[Bangkok]], Thailand's best blues rock bands, and Rolling Stones tribute band Midnight Ramblers, also based in Bangkok.

[[Rao Bahadur]] '''Vappala Pangunni Menon''', [[Order of the Star of India|CSI]], [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]] (30 September 1893 &amp;ndash; 31 December 1965) was an Indian [[civil servant]] who was the Constitutional Adviser&lt;ref name=&quot;VP Menon&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.forgotten-raj.org/doc/vp6.pdf |title=V P Menon – The Forgotten Architect of Modern India |work=Forgotten Raj |date=13 April 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726061929/http://www.forgotten-raj.org/doc/vp6.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VP Menon Architect&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/india/vpmenon.htm |title=V P Menon – The Forgotten Architect of Modern India |work= |date= |accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  Political Reforms Commissioner to the last three Viceroys during British rule in India.

He played a vital role in India's [[partition of India|partition]] and [[Political integration of India|political integration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/research/how-vallabhbhai-patel-v-p-menon-and-mountbatten-unified-india-4915468/|title=How Vallabhbhai Patel, V P Menon and Mountbatten unified India|date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his life, he became a member of the free-market–oriented [[Swatantra Party]].

==Personal life==
The son of a school headmaster in [[Kerala]], Menon worked as a railway stoker, coal miner and Bangalore tobacco company clerk before gaining a junior post in the Indian Civil Service. By working assiduously, Menon rose through the ranks to become the highest serving Indian officer in [[British India]]. In 1946, he was appointed Political Reforms Commissioner to the British Viceroy.

In [[Patrick French]]'s ''India: A Portrait'', a biographical book on the Indian Subcontinent, it is mentioned that VP Menon moved in with his Keralite friends after his wife left him and returned to south India. The two friends, who were a couple, had arranged his marriage and helped raise his two sons – Pangunni Anantan Menon and Pangunni Shankaran Menon. When the husband died, Menon married his widow.&lt;ref&gt;India - a portrait by Patrick French - page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Menon was given the title of ''[[Rao Bahadur]]'', appointed a [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]] in the 1941 Birthday Honours &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35184/supplements/3285 London Gazette, 6 June 1941]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Order of the Star of India|CSI]] in the 1946 Birthday Honours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37598/supplements/2760 London Gazette, 13 June 1946]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partition of India==
:''See Also: [[Indian Independence Movement]], [[Partition of India]]''

Menon was the political advisor of the last [[Viceroy of India]], Lord [[Louis Mountbatten]]. When the interim Government had collapsed due to the rivalry between the [[Indian National Congress]] and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]], Menon had proposed to Mountbatten, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], the Indian leaders, the Muslim League's plan to partition India into two independent nations - India and [[Pakistan]].

Menon's resourcefulness during this period caught the eye of Sardar Patel, who would become the [[Deputy Prime Minister of India]] in 1947.

VP Menon was present at the meeting between Lord Mountbatten and [[Hanwant Singh]], Maharaja of [[Jodhpur]]. It was at this meeting that Hanwant Singh signed the instrument of accession to India. After he had signed and the Viceroy Mountbatten left, only Menon was in the room with him. The Maharaja took out a .22 calibre pistol and pointed it at Menon and said 'I refuse to take your dictation'. Menon told him that he would be making a very serious mistake by threatening him and would not be able to get the accession abrogated in any case.&lt;ref&gt;India - a portrait by Patrick French (page 10)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration of India==
{{main|Political Integration of India}}

After the independence of India, Menon became the secretary of the Ministry of the States, headed by [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], with whom he had developed a bond of trust. Patel respected Menon's political genius and work ethic, while Menon obtained the respect for his work that a civil servant needs from his political superior.

Menon worked closely with Patel over the integration of over 565 [[princely state]]s into the [[union of India]], managing the diplomacy between the States Ministry and the various Indian princes, acting as Patel's envoy and striking deals with reluctant princes and rulers. Patel respected Menon's ingenuity in diplomacy, and often did not question if Menon exceeded any instructions.

Menon also worked with Patel over the military action against the hostile states of [[Junagadh]] and [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]], as well as advising Nehru and Patel on relations with [[Pakistan]] and the [[History of the Kashmir conflict|Kashmir conflict]]. The Cabinet had dispatched Menon to obtain the accession of [[Kashmir]] into India in 1947.

At Sardar Patel's behest, Menon subsequently wrote a book &quot;The story of the integration of the Indian states&quot; describing the process they had adopted for each state, based on his first hand experiences of the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;menon&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Menon |first1=V.P. |title=The story of the integration of the Indian states |date=15 September 1955 |publisher=Longman Greens and Co |location=Bangalore }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bjpcopy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Menon |first1=V.P. |title=Pdf copy of the book &quot;The Story of the Integration of the Indian States&quot; |url=http://lib.bjplibrary.org/jspui/bitstream/123456789/132/1/V.P.Menon%20-%20Integration%20of%20Princely%20States.pdf |website=BJP E-Library |publisher=Bharatiya Janata Party |accessdate=22 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==

The partnership between Patel and Menon was of a rare kind. He was right hand of Sardar Patel and played a major role in integration of Independent India. Almost every Indian politician was allergic to civil servants{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}, owing to their participation in the [[British Raj]]. Many Congressmen had demanded stripping the service of its privileges or disbanding it all together, owing to the role of British-era officers in imprisoning Congress leaders{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}. Nehru himself was reluctant to listen to the civil servants who worked under him{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}. He was [[Governor of Odisha]] (''Orissa then'') for a short period in 1951.
Thus, after Patel's death in 1950, Menon himself retired from the newly formed [[Indian Administrative Service]]. He  authored  a book on the [[political integration of India]], ''The Story of the Integration of Indian States'' and on the [[partition of India]], ''Transfer of Power''. He later joined [[Swatantra Party]]

A successful [[WP:AID]] article, I think this is of great significance just now. -[[User:Litefantastic|Litefantastic]] 18:07, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

Someone should convert all of the external links that are in the body of the article into numbered references. At the very least, people have to stop inserting new external links that disrupt the existing numbered references. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSchmidt]] 18:18, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': Is this really stable? [[User:KingTT|KingTT]] 19:46, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

*'''Object''', the following need to be addressed:
#The lead needs to mention why H5N1 is a concern.
#html links should be converted to footnotes and full details of source included (this seems to be in progress)
#By my understanding 2004/05 isn't the first time HN51 has been recorded, can some information on the first occurence and subsequent identificaion of the virus be added.
#The Asia and beyond section reads like the current events page, please try and incorporte this information into cohesive paragraphs.
#Merge pig cases and big cat cases into a sectional called HN51 in other animals.
#The worst case scenario section should probably be L2 heading and notably this is the only unsourced section, it would be useful for the reader to know which agencies are concerned about a pandemic. Information on planning for a pandemic and government responses would also be valuable addtions.
#Remove see alsos that are already mentioed in the text.
--[[User:Petaholmes|nixie]] 23:49, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' the cleanup taskforce have been looking at this and have yet to decide it is &quot;clean&quot; - I don't know what that means but we should remember that. [[User:Andreww|Andreww]] 09:16, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
*'''Object''', just looking at the lead section:
# Third paragraph. &quot;Usually these flu viruses &quot; which flu viruses - N5H1 or bird flu in general? The Spanish flu was H1N1 so I guess bird flu in general but it's not clear.
# Is this about one particular H5N1 virus or about H5N1 viruses in general? I think H5N1 existed before 1997 but it only became so dangerous then. 
[[User:Andreww|Andreww]] 09:24, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
* '''Support''': extensive, thorough, very well researched, structured and illustrated, this is the quintessential featured article. Furthermore, it is currently of high relevance and interest and will attract kudos and lots of traffic to Wikipedia once again. I suggest we focus on this one for rapid approval. --[[User:Rsabbatini|R.Sabbatini]] 10:28, 7 November 2005 (UTC)
*'''Strong object''' Will not meet stability criterion until the current scare goes away. Has many short subsections and paragraphs. Inline external links should probably be converted to footnotes. The &quot;Asia and beyond&quot; section is far from being brilliant prose. Poor layout by the end of the article. &quot;Worst case scenario section&quot; should be ''far'' longer and include current research. There is absolutely ''no info'' on the 1997 outbreak beyond a passing mention on the lead... and the list goes on. -- [[User:Rune.welsh|Rune Welsh]] | [[User_talk:Rune.welsh|&amp;tau;&amp;alpha;&amp;lambda;&amp;kappa;]] | [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|&lt;font color=&quot;#339900&quot;&gt;Esperanza&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:46, 8 November 2005 (UTC)
*'''Support''' I have this page on my watchlist and I haven't seen any stability problems at all, there doesn't seem to be any sort of popularity of the article among vandals, and there don't seem to be any edit wars due to content disputes. But I don't think it matters, shouldn't this of been closed months ago? [[User:Homestarmy|Homestarmy]] 15:40, 26 March 2006 (UTC)
*'''Comment''':
#Infobox should be at the top of the article, instead of pushed down by an image.
#Image #1841 (the colorized transmission electron micrograph of H5N1) is displayed twice, this is redundant.
#The Wikinews template seems to be placed in an odd section in the middle of the article. --[[User:Hetar|Hetar]] 03:20, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': As Hetar pointed out, [[H5N1]] is a regular hotbed of dispute over where to place images. In no way ready for Featured Article status. Move on, nothing to see here. [[User:WAS 4.250|WAS 4.250]] 04:53, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
*'''Comment.''' I have delisted this nomination. It seems to be a mix of several old noms--look at the dates of the comments! Please follow the instructions for re-nominations at the top of [[WP:FAC]]. Move any old noms to archives (separate archives!). Start the new nom from scratch with a new header (not one dated October 2005), which contains links to these archives, and without any old comments, and post it at the top (not the foot) of [[WP:FAC]]. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be difficult, but a nomination that conflates at least three different discussions just won't work. And how about the comments from April 6 (day before yesterday..?) Don't just put this back, please. [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] | [[User talk:Bishonen|talk]] 18:54, 8 April 2006 (UTC).
*'''Comment.''' Since this is a [[WP:GACo]], I suggest holding this off till monday when it'll be rotated out. I'll re-nominate it at that point myself if no one else has. (I think that most if not all of the above objections have been adressed either before, or during the improvement drive.) --[[User:Barberio|Barberio]] 19:57, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

==History==
[[File:Bessborough Construction.jpg|thumb|The hotel under construction in 1931.]]
After the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] built a railway hotel in Regina in 1926, the Saskatoon business community lobbied [[Canadian National Railway]] to build one in [[Saskatoon]]. On December 31, 1928, Sir Henry Thorton, President of the Canadian National Railway, announced that it would build a similar hotel in Saskatoon. In February, 1930, the excavation of the site began using a steam thawer and gasoline excavator.  In exchange for building a &quot;chateau&quot; style hotel with a minimum of 200 rooms, the city exempted the railway from [[property tax]] on the hotel for 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|mode=cs1|chapter-url=http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/private/acts/PR-S66.PDF|chapter=An Act to confirm a certain Byllaw of the City of Saskatoon and a certain Agreement entered into between Canadian Northern Railway Company and the Canadian National Railway Company of the one part and The City of Saskatoon of the other part and for the other purposes being a private act|title=Statutes of Saskatchewan|chapter-format=PDF|date=27 March 1930|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 1931, Walter Pratt, General Manager of Hotels, Sleeping and Dining Cars of the Canadian National Railway, announced that [[Excellency|His Excellency]] [[Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough|The 9th Earl of Bessborough]], 14th [[Governor General of Canada]], had given his consent for the hotel to be formally named &quot;The Bessborough.&quot; The Earl and the Countess visited the hotel under construction in 1932. Construction was completed in 1932 but the difficult financial times of the [[Great Depression in Canada|Great Depression]] prevented the hotel from opening until Horace N. Stovin became the first official registered guest, on December 10, 1935.

In 1972, Donald, Dick, and [[Marc Baltzan]] purchased the Bessborough. Then, [[Canadian Pacific Hotels]] purchased [[Canadian National Hotels]] in 1982. The Bessborough was placed under CP Hotels' subsidiary [[Delta Hotels]] in the 1990s. In 1999, CP Hotels and Delta Hotels were placed under [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts]]. It was acquired by the [[Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust]] in 1998, and in 1999, a $9,000,000 restoration of the Bessborough Hotel was completed to return many of its historical features. The hotel underwent a major renovation in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;frommers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Delta Bessborough|publisher=Frommer's|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/saskatoon/H45644.html|accessdate=13 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains under the [[Delta Hotels]] banner and is now owned by [[Marriott International]].

The following year, the group returned for a third year to the Edinburgh fringe and subsequently the [[Belfast]] theatre festival with a show entitled ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060421/http://www.dutchelm.co.uk/prison &quot;Prison&quot;]''.

He co-wrote and starred in the BBC Radio 4 comedy series ''[[Deep Trouble (radio comedy series)|Deep Trouble]] ''with [[Ben Willbond]]. As an actor, he appeared in various British TV comedies such as Coupling, Snuffbox and My Life in Film, and numerous commercials both on screen and as a voiceover artist. He also wrote several episodes of the MTV puppet sitcom &quot;[[Fur TV]]&quot;.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Smith is the director/producer of the 2013 [[BBC Two]] comedy-thriller ''[[The Wrong Mans (UK TV series)|The Wrong Mans]]'', written by [[James Corden]], [[Mathew Baynton]] and [[Tom Basden]]. The show, a co-production between [[BBC]] and [[Hulu]], is about a pair of lowly office workers who become unwittingly embroiled in a deadly criminal conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/the_wrong_mans/details/ Comedy.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith directed, co-wrote and co-produced the 2016 BBC Two comedy-thriller ''[[Stag (miniseries)|Stag]]''. The series, set in the Scottish Highlands, is about a group of young men on a stag weekend and their fight to escape a mystery killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Two - Stag - Credits|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b073gz3n/credits|website=BBC Two - Stag - Credits|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Westin Nova Scotian''' is a Canadian hotel located in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], owned and operated by New Castle Hotels and Resorts. It was built in 1928 by the [[Canadian National Railway]] as the Nova Scotian Hotel and after several changes of owners and names in the late 20th century became the Westin Nova Scotian in 1996.

The hotel has been called Halifax's &quot;grande dame&quot; and has played host to numerous dignitaries, royalty, and celebrities over 85 years of existence.&lt;ref name=demont/&gt;&lt;ref name=gaz/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pier21in1934.jpg|thumb|left|The Nova Scotian Hotel in 1934 with the [[RMS Majestic (1914)|RMS ''Majestic'']] docked at [[Pier 21]] on the left and the Halifax Railway Station on the right.]]
The hotel was built by the [[Canadian National Railways]]. Construction began in 1928 and it opened on 23 June 1930 as the '''Nova Scotian Hotel'''.&lt;ref name=demont/&gt; The hotel was the final part of the [[Halifax, Nova Scotia railway station#South End terminal project|South End terminal project]] which had seen the new [[Halifax, Nova Scotia railway station|Halifax Railway Station]] moved from the north end to the south end of [[Barrington Street]] as well as the opening of the Halifax Ocean Terminal, which included [[Pier 21]], a trans-Atlantic Ocean liner passenger terminal. The hotel was directly connected by an interior walkway to the Halifax Railway Station and by an overhead walkway to Pier 21.

The hotel, like others opened by [[Canadian National Hotels]], was designed by [[Archibald and Schofield]], comprising the Canadian architects John Smith Archibald and John Schofield. It was designed as a complex with the [[Halifax, Nova Scotia railway station|Halifax railway station]] and the Cornwallis Park across the street. The central axis of the park is aligned with the front entrance of the Nova Scotian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ziobrowski|first1=Peter|title=Grand Entries - The Hotel Nova Scotian and the CN Train Station|url=http://halifaxbloggers.ca/builthalifax/2015/02/grand-entries-the-hotel-nova-scotia-and-the-cn-train-station/|publisher=BuiltHalifax.ca|date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel had 130 rooms and five suites over eight storeys. The Atlantic Ballroom could accommodate up to 275 dinner guests.&lt;ref name=westin/&gt; A new wing was built to the north in 1959, adding 161 more rooms including nine more suites.&lt;ref name=westin/&gt; In 1966, the name was changed to the '''Hotel Nova Scotian'''.

[[Elizabeth II]], Queen of Canada has stayed in the hotel twice, once in the 1950s and once in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=westin85&gt;{{cite web|title=The Westin Nova Scotian Celebrates 85th Anniversary|url=http://assets.thewestinnovascotian.com/lps/assets/u/The-Westin-Nova-Scotian-Celebrates-85th-Anniversary-1.pdf|publisher=Westin Nova Scotian|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Charles]] and [[Princess Diana]] attended a state dinner on 15 June 1983 at the Hotel Nova Scotian hosted by Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]. The 700 guests enjoyed a dinner of Canadian wines and cuisine and Trudeau told the Royal couple they had begun their visit in &quot;the most friendly part of Canada.&quot; A crowd of thousands grew outside the hotel hoping to catch a glimpse of the couple before they returned to the [[HMY Britannia|HMY ''Britannia'']] for their departure from Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Michael|title=Crowd cheers Princess and PM|work=The Globe and Mail|date=16 June 1983|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotel was sold by [[Canadian National Hotels]] in 1981 when that chain divested all of its properties in the early 1980s. It was purchased by Revenue Hotels and in 1989 [[Hilton International|Hilton Hotels]] took over management and the name changed to the '''Halifax Hilton'''.&lt;ref name=gaz&gt;{{cite news|title=Nova Scotian joins Hilton hotel chain|work=Montreal Gazette|agency=Canadian Press|date=2 May 1989|page=D2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hilton invested $15 million to upgrade the hotel.&lt;ref name=demont/&gt;

Revenue Hotels sought to turn the hotel into a casino, but the bid failed.&lt;ref name=demont&gt;{{cite news|last1=Demont|first1=John|title=Westin Nova Scotian: Halifax grande dame turns 85|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/1295654-westin-nova-scotian-halifax-grande-dame-turns-85|work=Halifax Chronicle-Herald|date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They closed the hotel in 1993, and the building was used as a temporary dormitory by [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary's University]] for several years after a student residence underwent emergency repairs due to an unstable wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;decay&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=Kevin|title=Decay of university buildings in the Maritimes has reached a crisis|work=The Globe and Mail|date=5 February 1994|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A company was hired to demolish the hotel. It was saved when the property was purchased, in April 1996, by New Castle Hotels and Resorts of Connecticut. The hotel was reportedly only a week away from demolition.&lt;ref name=demont/&gt; An additional $4 million was put into renovating the hotel and it reopened on 1 December 1996 as '''The Westin Nova Scotian'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A hotel by any other name|work=Halifax-HRM West Community Herald|date=3 January 2011|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=westin&gt;{{cite web|title=The Westin Nova Scotian Hotel History|url=http://www.thewestinnovascotian.com/hotel-history|publisher=Westin Nova Scotian|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Nova Scotian Hotel and Halifax railway station 1931.jpg|thumb|left|''[[RMS Olympic]]'' docked behind the Nova Scotian in 1931.]]
The hotel today is a historic 15-storey structure overlooking Cornwallis Park to the west and the seaport to the east. Cruise ships still regularly dock alongside the hotel and the adjacent railway station still offers regular service to [[Montreal]] via the ''[[Ocean (train)|Ocean]]''. There are now 310 rooms in the hotel, including 10 suites. The Crown Suite, on the 11th floor, offers sweeping views of [[Halifax Harbour]] and is where Queen Elizabeth II stayed in the past.&lt;ref name=demont/&gt;

The hotel is home to {{convert|23000|sqft|sqm}} of space for meetings, conferences, and weddings. A restaurant, Elements on Hollis, opened in 2011 and showcases Nova Scotian cuisine. Roy's Lounge is a contemporary cocktail lounge named after bartender Roy Clorey, who began bartending at the Hotel Nova Scotian in 1963. The hotel also houses a fitness centre, an indoor saltwater pool, and a business centre.

The area surrounding the hotel has become thoroughly modernized in recent decades. The old coal-fired power station across the street was recently renovated to serve as the corporate headquarters of [[Nova Scotia Power]], and is the first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED platinum]]-certified building in Atlantic Canada. The seaport district is now home to the [[Halifax Farmers' Market]], the [[Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21|Canadian Museum of Immigration]], and [[NSCAD University]] – in addition to the cruise ship terminal.

Nominated for speedy deletion, but not a speedy candidate, so sending to AfD. &lt;s&gt;I suggest merging this and [[First Majority Catholic Supreme Court]] into a single article on [[Composition of the United States Supreme Court by religion]], which would surely be of interest to some.&lt;/s&gt; [[User:BD2412/deletion debates|&lt;font style=&quot;background: lightgreen&quot;&gt;BD2412&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:BD2412/deletion debates|'''T''']] 18:11, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

'''''Armeria''''' is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plants]].  These plants are sometimes known as &quot;lady's cushion&quot;, &quot;thrift&quot;, or &quot;sea pink&quot; (the latter because as they are often found on coastlines).  The genus counts over a hundred [[species]], mostly native to the [[Mediterranean]], although ''[[Armeria maritima]]'' is an exception, being distributed along the coasts of the Northern Hemisphere, including Ireland, parts of the United Kingdom such as Cornwall, and the [[Pembrokeshire Coast National Park]] in Wales.{{sfn|Armitage|2013}}

Some are popular with [[gardeners]] as [[Rock garden|rockery]] plants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Clifford N. Breitkreuz''' (born July 30, 1940 near [[Onoway]], [[Alberta]], Canada).  He was raised on a [[farm]] and lived there until he left to earn his [[university]] degrees (a B.A. from the [[University of Alberta]] and a B.Ed. from the [[University of Lethbridge]]).  In 1967 he returned to farming, and started teaching at Onoway Junior/Senior High School not long after that.  He taught for 7 years and later was elected as a member of parliament for Yellowhead for two terms (from 1993 to 2000). He was a winning candidate in the 2004 Alberta Senatorial Election and as such was a senator-in-waiting pending a vacant Alberta [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] (and a prime minister willing to honor the non-binding election). Breitkruez term as a senator-in-waiting expired with the [[2012 Alberta Senate nominee election]] in which he did not re-offer as a candidate. He still farms with his wife, Shirley.

'''William White,''' [[List of Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]] (1825–1900) was an [[England|English]] [[architect]], noted for his part in 19th century [[Gothic Revival architecture]] and [[Victorian restoration|church restorations]]. He was the son of a clergyman and great nephew of the writer and naturalist, [[Gilbert White]] of [[Selborne]].

After a five-year apprenticeship in [[Leamington Spa]] he moved to London as an improver in [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s practice where he remained for two years before setting up his own practice in [[Truro]] in 1847. In 1851 he returned to London and worked out of [[Wimpole Street]]. His style was close to that of [[William Butterfield]] and he built many [[church (building)|churches]].

The '''Fort Garry Hotel''' is a historic [[hotel]] in [[Downtown Winnipeg|Downtown]] [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. It is one of [[Canada's grand railway hotels]] and was designated as a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|1190|Fort Garry Hotel|20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A national heritage park connected to the hotel and to the remains of Upper Fort Garry was completed in 2017-18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Upper Fort Garry park work resuming|url = http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/upper-fort-garry-park-work-resuming-159161905.html|website = [[Winnipeg Free Press]]|accessdate = 2015-10-16|last = Kives|first = Bartley|date = 2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Built in 1913 by the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]], it is located one block from the railway's Union Station, and was the tallest structure in the city when it was completed. Like other Canadian railway hotels, it was constructed in the &quot;[[château]] style&quot; (also termed the &quot;neo-château&quot; or &quot;[[châteauesque]]&quot; style), which also reflects the [[François]] I style of hotel prevalent in the eastern United States at the turn-of-the-20th-century. Henry Janeway Hardenbegh initiated the architectural trend, with [[New York City]]'s [[Plaza Hotel]] (1906–07) as his most well known structure. The Fort Garry Hotel has more than a passing similarity to The Plaza, with related features that include: the classic base, shaft, and capital divisions of the skyscraper; flat facades with slightly projecting, four-bay end pavilions; an arcade of large, segmented windows below a prominent cornice; and, the composition of the steeply sloped roofs. Architects Ross and MacFarlane of [[Montreal]] modelled their original plans for the hotel after [[Ottawa]]'s [[Château Laurier]]; plans originally called for a 10-storey structure, but two floors were added during construction.

[[Image:FortGarryWinnipeg.jpg|thumb|left|The Fort Garry Hotel in 1913.]]
Initially, the new hotel was to be called The Selkirk,{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} but was instead named after [[Upper Fort Garry]], which once stood at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. The hotel was built at a strategic location on Broadway, between Fort and Garry Streets, providing a luxury hotel for railway travellers.  It was the first commercial building to be erected on Broadway and the only hotel to be built there. The hotel's early prominence led it to have many famous guests, including [[Nelson Eddy]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Charles Laughton]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Liberace]], [[Arthur Fiedler]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Gordie Howe]], [[Lester Pearson]], as well as [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], who stayed during their 1939 visit to Canada.

The hotel, originally owned by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, and later owned by the [[Canadian National Railway]] after Grand Trunk was nationalized and absorbed into CN. In 1979, the hotel was purchased by the prominent [[John Draper Perrin]] family of Winnipeg, who operated it as an independent hotel until 1987. It was then owned for a few years by a company controlled by Quebec hotelier Raymond Malenfant. Presently it is run as an independent hotel.

According to local folklore, the hotel is haunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada's top five haunted travel hot spots|url=http://www.canada.com/Canada+five+haunted+travel+spots/5603662/story.html|publisher=Canada.com|accessdate=14 November 2012|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fort Garry Hotel is infamous for its haunted Room 202. A woman apparently committed suicide in the room many years ago after hearing of the death of her husband in a car accident. Overcome with grief, she hanged herself in the closet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fort Garry Hotel, Winnipeg, Canada|url = http://www.hauntedrooms.com/fort-garry-hotel-winnipeg-canada|website = HauntedRooms.com|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CNR Radio ===
The Fort Garry Hotel was the site of the Winnipeg studio of [[CNR Radio]], the precursor to CBC Radio, between 1923 and 1932, using the original CKY transmitter on 665 KHz, moving to 780 KHz in 1925. CNR purchased time on stations they did not own, called &quot;phantom&quot; stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listing_and_histories/television/cbw-am|title=History of Canadian Broadcasting: CBW (AM)|last=|first=|date=|website=Canadian Communications Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dutch Elm Conservatoire''' is a British [[sketch comedy]] group, made up of five writers and actors: [[Stephen Evans (actor)|Stephen Evans]], [[Jim Field Smith]], [[Rufus Jones (comedian)|Rufus Jones]], [[Renton Skinner|Dan Renton Skinner]] and Jordan Long.
They performed on the comedy circuit in London, Edinburgh and on tour. In 2005 they were nominated for the prestigious [[Perrier Award]] at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].
The [[wiktionary:troupe|troupe]] first met together as a five towards the end 2002, with their stage debut in February 2003.

Subsequent to this, the [[BBC]] [[Contract|commissioned]] them to record a [[BBC Radio 4]] pilot. The resulting script, CONSPIRACY, was then developed for the stage. They took this new live show back to the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] in August 2005, again at the Pleasance Courtyard playing to sell-out audiences and picking up a [[Perrier Award]] nomination and a rare 5-star review from the Scotsman, amongst others. The show was directed by Ed Curtis.  On returning to London they performed the show to a sell-out West End audience, and early in 2006 they embarked on their first UK Tour which finished in March 2006.
As a group, the Dutch Elm Conservatoire have appeared on various TV and radio [[Radio programming|programmes]], including ''Loose Ends'', ''The Milk Run'' and ''28 Acts in 28 Minutes'' (all for the BBC). However, the four of them are busy actors and writers in their own right, with an extensive range of credits for screen, stage and radio. Between them, they have infiltrated almost every new comedy series of recent years on British television, including [[Hyperdrive (British TV series)|Hyperdrive]] (BBC), [[Nighty Night]] (BBC), ''Snuff Box'' (BBC), ''Mike Bassett: Manager'' ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]), ''Secret Smile'' ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]), [[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]] (BBC), ''My Life in Film''(BBC), ''The Robinsons'' (BBC), ''According to Bex'' (BBC), ''The Only Boy for Me'' ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]), ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'' ([[Channel 4]]), [[My Family]] (BBC), [[Coupling (UK TV series)|Coupling]] (BBC), [[Extras (TV series)|Extras]] (BBC), [[Love Soup]] (BBC), ''Fear of Fanny'' (BBC), ''15 Storeys High'' (BBC) and ''[[Bedsitcom]]'' ([[Channel 4]]), not to mention films and radio. They also crop up frequently in [[voice-overs]], [[commercials]] and [[corporation|corporate]] work in [[UK|Britain]] and abroad, and have writing credits across all the major [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]] and [[Digital data|digital]] channels.

They last performed as a five at the August 2006 [[Edinburgh Fringe]] and the [[Belfast]] theatre festival (Nov '06), with a show entitled ''Dutch Elm Conservatoire in Prison''

During 2007/08 ''The Dutch Elm Conservatoire'' could be seen performing on the [[BBC Three]] comedy show entitled ''Comedy Shuffle'' and heard on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s series of ''28 Acts in 28 Minutes''. They also made several appearances in the second series of ''Comedy Cuts'' for [[ITV2]] during 2008.

The '''Jasper Park Lodge''' opened in 1922&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairmont.com/jasper/hotelhistory/ Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge - Hotel History]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]], [[Alberta]], Canada and is situated on the shores of [[Lac Beauvert]].

== History ==
The lodge had first been established in 1915 as a &quot;Tent City,&quot; in association with the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]], but by the 1920s the property was under the management of [[Canadian National Hotels]]. Eight bungalows were constructed in 1921, and work began on additional cabins and a main lodge building two years later.  The main building, reputed to be the largest single-level log structure in the world, was destroyed by fire in 1952;&lt;ref name=1952fire&gt;{{cite news | url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/July+1952+Blaze+destroys+Jasper+Park+Lodge/6937026/story.html | title=
July 15, 1952: Blaze destroys Jasper Park Lodge | newspaper=[[Edmonton Journal]] | publisher=[[Postmedia Network]] | date=2012-07-15 | accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was replaced by the current lodge, which was completed the following year. Jasper Park Lodge was sold to [[Canadian Pacific Hotels]] in 1988 and now operates as '''Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge'''. In 2006, it was purchased by [[Oxford Properties]], the real estate investment arm of [[OMERS|Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS)]], but is operated by [[Fairmont Hotels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/business/story.html?id=f7504619-d278-4344-bfa9-64a79c223208 Constantineau, Bruce. &quot;Pension plan buys 7 Fairmont hotels for about $1.5b,&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301011734/http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/business/story.html?id=f7504619-d278-4344-bfa9-64a79c223208 |date=2012-03-01 }}, Vancouver Sun. October 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many celebrities have stayed, including [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]]. It is also a favoured spot of the Royal Family, with visits from King [[George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] in 1939 and Her Majesty [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] in 2005.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A $6.7 million Fairmont spa was added to the Lodge in fall 2010. In 2015-16, a $16 million renovation to all rooms (Fairmont, Deluxe, Junior Suites and Lakefront Suites) was completed to modernize the decor. ORSO Trattoria, the hotel's first Italian restaurant, was also added to the dining options, which includes The Nook Chophouse, Emerald Lounge &amp; Patio, Thompson's Terrace (golf course) and Oka Sushi.

'''Lagoa do Fogo''' (''Lake/Lagoon of Fire'') is a [[crater lake]] within the [[Água de Pau Massif]] [[stratovolcano]] in the center of the island of [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]] in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] archipelago of the [[Azores]]. The highest lake located on the island of São Miguel, the region is protected by governmental regulation that does not permit the construction around the lake.

==History==
Since 1974, the ''Lagoa do Fogo'' had been under the administration of national legislation as a protected area, forming the ''Reserva da Lagoa do Fogo'' (''Natural Reserve of Lagoa do Fogo'') an area that includes approximately {{convert|2182|ha|m2}}, founded by Decree-law 152/74 (15 April 1974). It was also covered under a supplementary Decree-Law 9/79.&lt;ref&gt;IGP (2005); DCA/UA (2004); DRA (2004); DROTRH/SRA et al. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Reserva Natural da Lagoa do Fogo'' was created in 1982, under terms of Regional Decree 10/82/A on 18 June 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;Santos1991&quot;&gt;Santos et al. (1991a)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AIdeias&quot;&gt;Ana Ideias (May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AmbienteRN&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=Reserva Natural da Lagoa do Fogo |editor=DRA |publisher=Direção Regional do Ambiente |language=Portuguese |year=2015 |location=Horta (Azores), Portugal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the area was included in the Natura 2000 network, and classified as the ''Site of Communitarian Importance of Lagoa do Fogo''.&lt;ref name=AmbienteRN/&gt;

The nature reserve was integrated into the Nature Park of São Miguel, under Decree-Law 19/2008A (8 July 2008), which included the entire watershed of the Laoga.&lt;ref name=&quot;DR4261&quot;&gt;Diário da República, (8 July 2008), p.4261&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Lagoa do Fogo, Miradouro da Serra da Barrosa, Vila Franca do Campo, ilha de São Miguel, Açores.JPG|thumb|235px|left|A view of the lake from the scenic overlook of Pico do Barrosa]]
[[File:2012-10-15 13-46-19 Portugal Azores Lombadas.JPG|thumb|235px|left|The fine, sedimentary beach of Lagoa do Fogo, with view of crater rim]]
Lagoa do Fogo is one of the largest of the waterbodies in the Azores, and occupies the central caldera of the [[Água de Pau Massif]], in the central area of the island of São Miguel.&lt;ref name=AmbienteRN/&gt; The caldera is the youngest volcano on the island of São Miguel, formed approximately 15 000 years ago, resulting from the collapse at the top of the volcano, some 5000 years ago. The last eruption occurred in 1563.&lt;ref name=AmbienteRN/&gt; It falls within the borders of the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parishes]] of [[Conceição (Ribeira Grande)|Conceição]], [[Matriz (Ribeira Grande)|Matriz]] and [[Água de Alto]], in the [[Concelho|municipalities]] of [[Ribeira Grande (Azores)|Ribeira Grande]] and [[Vila Franca do Campo]], respectively.&lt;ref name=AIdeias/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pacheco et al. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is part of the hydrological watershed of the same name. The margins of the lake are located {{convert|575|m|ft}} above sea level, although the crater rim, which extends to Pico da Barrosa is located at approximately {{convert|949|m|ft}} altitude.&lt;ref name=Santos1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIdeias/&gt;&lt;ref name=AmbienteRN/&gt; The internal flanks of the crater (characterized by abrupt 48º cliffs) are occupied by the elliptical lake, {{convert|3|x|2.5|km|mi}} and {{convert|30|m|ft}} deep.&lt;ref name=AIdeias/&gt;&lt;ref name=AmbienteRN/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DROTRH&quot;&gt;DROTRH/SRA et al. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

The carved relief affects the course of hydrographic run-off, which is accentuated by torrential precipitation in the region, resulting in accentuated erosion and deposition along the margins.&lt;ref name=AIdeias/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LNEC (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of the watercourses are temporary or torrential, with the greatest run-off occurring in the winter, and little in the summer, with few permanent ravines.&lt;ref name=AIdeias/&gt;&lt;ref name=DROTRH/&gt; There are only two permanent effluents in the lake, one to the western crater rim in Barrosa, and the other in the south-southeast.&lt;ref name=Santos1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIdeias/&gt; The lake is maintained from mainly, direct precipitation over the caldera and from superficial run-off from the watersheds, where nutrient infiltration is common. The lake's waters support local aquifers in the lowlands and provide potable water to the settlements in the southern flanks of the caldera.&lt;ref name=Santos1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIdeias/&gt;

===Biome===
From the west to south, the crater is covered in brush and scrub, while in the east and north (where declives are minor) the vegetation is much denser and covered in some forest. Between the crater wall and lake is a northern margin/beach consisting of sedimentary, with little vegetation.&lt;ref name=Santos1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIdeias/&gt; Much of the land surrounding the crater is occupied by largely parcels of median {{convert|283|ha|m2}} in size, {{convert|61|ha|m2}} of forested production and endemic Macronesian species.&lt;ref name=AIdeias/&gt; Since 2001, the caldera and lake have been part of the Rede Natura network of sites of communitarian interest, for special conservation by European Commission (dated 28 December 2001) and the Habitats Directive 92/43/CEE.&lt;ref&gt;DRA (2004); DROTRH/SRA et al. (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; There are no human settlements or operations within the crater.&lt;ref name=AIdeias/&gt;

Within the perimeter of the nature reserve, lake and caldera flanks, are many endemic Azorean plant species, including the Azores juniper (''[[Juniperus brevifolia]]''), Azores laurel (''[[Laurus azorica]]'') and buckthorn (''[[Frangula azorica]]''), in addition to St. John's wort (''[[Hypericum foliosum]]''), Azores heather (''[[Erica azorica]]'') and Mediterranean spurge (''[[Euphorbia stygiana]]'').&lt;ref name=AmbienteRN/&gt;

Small birds are the primary animal species within the caldera, in addition to some larger birds, such as kites or seagulls; terrestrial birds include the Azores wood pigeon (''[[Azores wood pigeon|Columba palumbus azorica]]''), Azorean buzzard (''[[common buzzard#Systematics|Buteo buteo rothschildi]]''), the grey wagtail (''[[grey wagtail|Motocilla cinerea]]'') and the Azorean common blackbird ''([[common blackbird#Subspecies|Turdus merula azorensis]]''), as well as marine birds such as yellow-legged gull (''[[Larus cachinnans atlantis]]'') and the common tern (''[[Sterna hirundo]]'').&lt;ref name=AmbienteRN/&gt;

The '''Charles Pinckney National Historic Site''' is a unit of the United States [[National Park Service]], preserving a portion of [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney's]] '''Snee Farm''' [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] and country retreat.&lt;ref name=nps_hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/chpi/learn/historyculture/upload/CHPI_HRS.pdf|title=Cultural Resource History of Charles Pinckney National Historic Site|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = nrhpinv&gt;{{Cite web | last =  Snell | first = Charles W. | title = Snee Farm (Charles Pinckney Farm) | work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | publisher = [[National Park Service]] | date = January 15, 1973 | url = {{NHLS url|id=73001702}} | format = pdf | accessdate = 4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = nrhpphotos&gt;{{Cite web | title = Snee Farm (Charles Pinckney Farm) | work = Photographs | publisher = [[National Park Service]]| url = {{NHLS url|id=73001702|photos=y}} | format = pdf | accessdate = 4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = scdah&gt;{{Cite web | title = Snee Farm, Charleston County (Long Point Rd, off U.S. Hwy. 17, Mount Pleasant vicinity) | work = National Register Properties in South Carolina | publisher = South Carolina Department of Archives and History | url = http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/charleston/S10817710054/index.htm  | accessdate = 4 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is located at 1254 Long Point Road, [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina]].  Pinckney (1757-1824) was a member of a prominent political family in South Carolina.  

He fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]], was held for a period as prisoner in the North, and returned to the state in 1783. He served as a delegate to the constitutional convention where he contributed to drafting the [[United States Constitution]].  He was elected to three non-consecutive terms as [[Governor of South Carolina]], and as a member of the [[United States Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. 

He was appointed as President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s minister to [[Spain]], after he helped the candidate win the presidential campaign of 1800.  This Snee Farm site was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1973, and was designated a [[National Historical Park|National Historic Site]] in 1988.

==Setting==
The Charles Pinckney National Historic Site is located about {{convert|10|mi|km}} northeast of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], on {{convert|25|acre|ha}} of Wando Neck, a peninsula formed at the confluence of the [[Wando River|Wando ]] and [[Cooper River (South Carolina)|Cooper]] rivers.  The site has wooded and swampy areas on the eastern and western parts of the property, and a manicured grassy area with ornamental plantings around the [[Plantation house in the Southern United States|main house]].  The property includes, in addition to the main house, a barn, corncrib, and caretaker's residence.  A stone [[cenotaph]] was erected in the late 20th century to commemorate [[Colonel Charles Pinckney]], the father of governor Pinckney, who had acquired and developed Snee Farm as a rice and indigo plantation. It may have replaced an historic one installed by the younger Pinckney about 1785.&lt;ref name=nps_hist/&gt;

==History==
Snee Farm was acquired by Colonel Charles Pinckney in 1754; he developed its 715 acres for the commodity crops of rice and indigo. He bequeathed it to his son [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles]], who inherited it in 1782.  The younger Pinckney used Snee Farm as a working plantation and country estate (it was conveniently accessible to Charleston by boat) until about 1816, when he placed the property in trust to settle debts.  

The property was acquired in 1817 by Francis G. Deliesselines, who had it surveyed. William Mathews, another Low Country planter, bought the property in 1828. He demolished the existing buildings and had a new main house built that year, apparently on the original site of the first foundations. Mathews also had other plantations, and held a total of 352 slaves,&lt;ref name=&quot;sneeHist&quot;/&gt; indicating that he owned thousands of acres. He owned Snee Farm into 1848.

The Coastal Cottage at Snee Farm is typical of its time, and representative of a vernacular style for country living, although it also features some refined spaces for entertaining. It is rectangular in plan with a side-gable roof, full-width front porch, and a brick pier foundation. The interior features elaborate molding, paneling, and other decorative details. A slave row of cabins was built perpendicular to the main road.&lt;ref name=&quot;sneeHist&quot;&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/chpi/learn/historyculture/upload/CHPI_HRS.pdf CHAPTER  TWO: &quot;THE  LOW COUNTRY COASTAL COTTAGE AND SNEE FARM, 1828 – 1941&quot;], ''Charles Pinckney National Historic Site: Historic Resource Study'', pp. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

The 715-acre estate and its outbuildings remained largely intact until the 1970s, when the owners subdivided it to profit from development near Charleston. The central portion of the historic estate, the house and 28 acres, makes up the current site, which was purchased in 1988 by preservationists. Following the passage of enabling legislation by the United States Congress, the [[National Park Service]] purchased the current site. Because the site no longer has any structures associated with the Pinckneys, details of their time on the property are limited to archaeological and documentary work.&lt;ref name=nps_hist/&gt;

'''''Acantholimon''''' ('''prickly thrift''') is a [[genus]] of small [[flowering plants]] within the plumbago or leadwort family, [[Plumbaginaceae]]. They are distributed from southeastern [[Europe]] to central [[Asia]] and also in [[South America]], but also cultivated elsewhere in [[rock garden]]s.

==Form==
The evergreen [[subshrub]]s are generally cushion to mat-forming, with densely tufted shoots bearing mostly awl (long, pointed spike) to needle or grass-like, prickle to spine-tipped hard-textured leaves. They have shortish, simple or branched flower stems which can be loose or dense. The summer-borne flowers are composed of a funnel-shaped [[Calyx (flower)|calyx]], usually with a flared membranous margin, and five spreading petals.&lt;ref name=alpine&gt;{{cite web| title=Iris willmottiana | year=2001|  url=http://encyclopaedia.alpinegardensociety.net/plants/Acantholimon | publisher=encyclopaedia.alpinegardensociety.net | accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 310-room '''Delta Hotels Beausejour''' was opened in 1972 by the [[Canadian National Railway]] in the railway hub of [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]].

The first class hotel was operated by [[Canadian National Hotels]] until that chain was purchased by [[Canadian Pacific Hotels]] in 1988.  CP Hotels placed the Beauséjour under its [[Delta Hotels]] subsidiary in 1999 when CP Hotels took over the [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts]] chain, assuming the latter's name.

The hotel operates under the Delta banner as the '''Delta Hotels Beausejour''' and has the most rooms of any hotel in the province.  The hotel building was purchased by [[Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust|Legacy Hotels]] in 2006 and underwent a major renovation, which finished in 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''collateral source rule''', or '''collateral source doctrine''', is an [[United States of America|American]] [[case law]] evidentiary rule that prohibits the admission of evidence that the plaintiff or victim has received compensation from some source other than the damages sought against the defendant.&lt;ref name=&quot;el&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=California Medical Malpractice Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/malpractice_by_state/California.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=11 December 2017|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a personal injury action, evidence that the plaintiff's medical bills were paid by medical insurance, or by [[workers' compensation]], is not generally admissible.&lt;ref name=WCS&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ferrier|first1=Crystal|title=The Collateral Source Rule: A R ule of Evidence and a Rule of Damages|url=https://readingroom.law.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1046&amp;context=lib_student|website=Georgia State College of Law Reading Room|accessdate=11 December 2017|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collateral source doctrine has come under attack by [[tort reform]] advocates. They argue that if the plaintiff's injuries and damages have already been compensated, it is unfair and duplicative to allow an award of damages against the [[tortfeasor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Closing Arguments: Is Wisconsin’s collateral-source rule worth preserving?|url=http://wislawjournal.com/2016/03/10/closing-arguments-is-wisconsins-collateral-source-rule-worth-preserving/|website=Wisconsin Law Journal|publisher=The Daily Reporter Publishing Co.|accessdate=11 December 2017|date=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result numerous states have altered or partially abrogated the rule by [[statute]].&lt;ref name=NAMIC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.namic.org/issues/collateralSource |title=Collateral source reforms|publisher=NAMIC |accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;el&quot;/&gt;

'''Pyotr Konchalovsky''' (Petr Petrovich Konchalovsky, {{lang-ru|Пётр Петро́вич Кончало́вский}}; 21 February 1876 – 2 February 1956) was a Russian [[Painting|painter]], a member of the [[Jack of Diamonds (artists)|Jack of Diamonds]] group.

==Life and career==
Pyotr Konchalovsky was born in the village of [[Sloviansk|Slavianka]], [[Kharkov]] [[gubernia]] (currently [[Ukraine]]) on 21 February 1876. His father was an art publisher. In 1889, the Konchalovskys moved to Moscow and their house became a part of the Moscow art scene of the 1890s. Their house was often visited by [[Valentin Serov]], [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Vasily Surikov]]. Later, Pyotr married a daughter of Vasily Surikov, who always praised the art of his son-in-law.

During his [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] years Konchalovsky attended classes of [[Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]]. In 1896-1898 he traveled to Paris and studied at the [[Académie Julian]]. In 1899, he returned to Russia and entered the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], graduating in 1907. At the Academy, he studied under Savinsky, Zaleman and Kovalevsky.

[[File:Konchalovsky Alex Tolstoy.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Aleksei Nikolaevich Tolstoi]] visiting the artist]]
Since 1909, he exhibited frequently, participating in the Golden Fleece, Fraternity, [[Mir Iskusstva]], and New Society of Artists. He was a founding member of the society [[Jack of Diamonds (artists)|Jack of Diamonds]] in 1909.  Beginning in 1918 he taught art. In 1922, he had his first solo exhibition at the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].

During that period, he mostly drew [[still life]]s and landscapes. His paintings—as of all other Jacks of Diamond—were strongly influenced by [[Paul Cézanne]]. Later he started to paint portraits (often Ceremonial Portraits) that were considered as the examples of [[Socialist Realism]] style.

Pyotr Konchalovsky was a very prolific painter, and is known to have created more than five thousand works.

Many of his descendants were people in the world of art. His son [[Mikhail Petrovich Konchalovsky]] (b. 1906) was a notable painter. His daughter [[Natalia Konchalovskaya]] (1903–1988) was a notable children's writer and her husband [[Sergei Mikhalkov]] was a notable poet, the author of children's poetry and two versions of the [[National Anthem of the Soviet Union]] and the present [[National Anthem of Russia]]. They have two sons: [[Andrei Konchalovsky]] is a film writer, director and a painter, whose son [[Egor Konchalovsky|Egor]] is also a notable film director.  [[Nikita Mikhalkov]] is also a movie director who won the 1994 Best Foreign Language Film [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for ''[[Burnt by the Sun]]''.

The '''Irish Institute of Hellenic Studies at Athens''' (IIHSA) ({{lang-ga|Institiúid Éireannach san Ataen don Léann Heilléanach}}; {{lang-el|Ιρλανδικό Ινστιτούτο Ελληνικών Σπουδών στην Αθήνα}}) is one of the 17 [[List of Foreign Archaeological Institutes in Greece|foreign archaeological institutes]] operating in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. 

==General information, mission==
The IIHSA was officially founded in 1995 and has been fully operational since 2002. It aims to promote, coordinate, and assist Irish or Irish-based researchers who are active in Greece, to develop Irish-based archaeological projects in Greece, to raise the awareness and profile of [[Hellenic studies|Hellenic Studies]] in [[Ireland]] and to promote Irish culture in Greece. 

[[Image:Iihsa premises.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The IIHSA premises, in an [[Art Déco]] building in [[Exarcheia]].]]

==Activities==
Apart from its archaeological fieldwork (below), the IIHSA runs a lecture series, hosts occasional seminars and exhibitions, organises annual archaeological study tours for Irish students and operates a programme of bursaries enabling Irish students to undertake research in Greece. It also provides accommodation for Irish and international scholars active in Athens. Since 2007, the IIHSA organises annual conferences on changing (normally archaeological) topics. It has also been involved in Irish-themed cultural events outside Athens.

==Archaeological projects==
Since 2003, the IIHSA has been conducting an [[archaeological field survey|archeological survey]]  at [[Leivathos]] ([[Kefalonia]]); in 2007, it began an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] at [[Priniatikos Pyrgos]] (East [[Crete]]).

{{Organ system development}}
In [[animal]]s that [[viviparity|give live birth]], the '''fetal circulation''' is the [[circulatory system]] of a [[fetus]]. The term usually encompasses the entire [[placenta#fetoplacental circulation|fetoplacental circulation]], which includes the [[umbilical cord]] and the [[blood vessel]]s within the [[placenta]] that carry [[fetal hemoglobin|fetal blood]].

The fetal (prenatal) circulation differs from normal postnatal circulation,mainly because the lungs are not in use. Instead, the [[fetus]] obtains [[oxygen]] and [[nutrient]]s from the mother through the [[placenta]] and the [[umbilical cord]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitaker |first=Kent |chapter=Fetal Circulation |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3WK8XyAHYgC&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Comprehensive Perinatal and Pediatric Respiratory Care |publisher=Delmar Thomson Learning |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7668-1373-1 |pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[breathing]] and the severance of the [[umbilical cord]] prompt various [[neuroendocrine]] changes that shortly transform fetal circulation into postnatal circulation.

The fetal circulation of humans has been extensively studied by the [[health science]]s. Much is known also of fetal circulation in other animals, especially [[livestock]] and [[model organism]]s such as mice, through the health sciences, [[veterinary science]], and [[life science]]s generally.

==Structure==
Blood from the [[placenta]] is carried to the [[fetus]] by the [[umbilical vein]]. In humans, less than a third of this enters the fetal ''[[ductus venosus]]'' and is carried to the [[inferior vena cava]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9378(00)70504-7 | last1 = Kiserud | first1 = T. | last2 = Rasmussen | first2 = S. | last3 = Skulstad | first3 = S. | title = Blood flow and the degree of shunting through the ductus venosus in the human fetus | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 182 | issue = 1 Pt 1 | pages = 147–153 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10649170}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the rest enters the [[liver]] proper from the inferior border of the liver. The branch of the [[umbilical vein]] that supplies the right [[Liver#Lobes|lobe]] of the [[liver]] first joins with the [[portal vein]]. The blood then moves to the [[right atrium]] of the [[heart]]. In the fetus, there is an opening between the [[right atrium|right]] and [[left atrium]] (the ''[[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]]''), and most of the blood flows through this hole directly into the left atrium from the right atrium, thus bypassing [[pulmonary circulation]]. The continuation of this blood flow is into the left ventricle, and from there it is [[pump]]ed through the [[aorta]] into the body. Some of the blood moves from the aorta through the [[internal iliac arteries]] to the [[umbilical arteries]], and re-enters the [[placenta]], where [[carbon dioxide]] and other waste products from the fetus are taken up and enter the maternal circulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot;/&gt;

Some of the [[blood]] entering the right atrium does not pass directly to the [[left atrium]] through the ''[[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]]'', but enters the [[right ventricle]] and is pumped into the [[pulmonary artery]]. In the fetus, there is a special connection between the [[pulmonary artery]] and the [[aorta]], called the ''[[ductus arteriosus]]'', which directs most of this blood away from the lungs (which are not being used for [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] at this point as the [[fetus]] is suspended in [[amniotic fluid]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot;/&gt;

===Placenta===
{{main|Placenta}}
The circulatory system of the mother is not directly connected to that of the fetus, so the placenta functions as the respiratory center for the fetus as well as a site of filtration for plasma nutrients and wastes.  Water, glucose, amino acids, vitamins, and inorganic salts freely diffuse across the placenta along with oxygen.  The uterine arteries carry blood to the placenta, and the blood permeates the sponge-like material there.  Oxygen then diffuses from the placenta to the chorionic villus, an [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolus]]-like structure, where it is then carried to the umbilical vein.

===Before birth===
[[File:Fetal circulation.png|thumb|right|220px|Diagram of the human [[fetal circulatory system]].]]
The [[circulatory system]], consisting of the heart and blood vessels, forms relatively early during embryonic development, and continues to develop in complexity within the growing fetus.  A functional circulatory system is a biological necessity, since mammalian tissues can not grow more than a few cell layers thick without an active blood supply. The prenatal circulation of blood is different than the postnatal circulation, mainly because the lungs are not in use. The fetus obtains [[oxygen]] and nutrients from the mother through the [[placenta]] and the [[umbilical cord]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot;/&gt;

Blood from the placenta is carried to the fetus by the [[umbilical vein]]. About half of this enters the fetal ''[[ductus venosus]]'' and is carried to the [[inferior vena cava]], while the other half enters the [[liver]] proper from the inferior border of the liver. The branch of the umbilical vein that supplies the right lobe of the liver first joins with the [[portal vein]]. The blood then moves to the right atrium of the [[heart]]. In the fetus, there is an opening between the right and left atrium (the ''[[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]]''), and most of the blood flows from the right into the left atrium, thus bypassing [[pulmonary circulation]]. The majority of blood flow is into the left ventricle from where it is pumped through the [[aorta]] into the body. Some of the blood moves from the aorta through the internal iliac arteries to the umbilical arteries, and re-enters the placenta, where [[carbon dioxide]] and other waste products from the fetus are taken up and enter the woman's circulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot;/&gt;

Some of the blood from the right atrium does not enter the left atrium, but enters the right ventricle and is pumped into the [[pulmonary artery]]. In the fetus, there is a special connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, called the ''[[ductus arteriosus]]'', which directs most of this blood away from the lungs (which aren't being used for respiration at this point as the fetus is suspended in [[amniotic fluid]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker&quot;/&gt;

===After birth===
{{Main|Adaptation to extrauterine life}}
At birth, when the infant breathes for the first time, there is a decrease in the resistance in the pulmonary vasculature, which causes the pressure in the left atrium to increase relative to the pressure in the right atrium. This leads to the closure of the [[Foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]], which is then referred to as the [[fossa ovalis (heart)|fossa ovalis]]. Additionally, the increase in the concentration of oxygen in the blood leads to a decrease in [[prostaglandins]], causing closure of the [[ductus arteriosus]]. These closures prevent blood from bypassing pulmonary circulation, and therefore allow the neonate's blood to become oxygenated in the newly operational lungs.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book   | last1 = Le | first1 = Tao  | first2 = Vikas | last2 = Bhushan  | first3 = Neil | last3 = Vasan  | title = First Aid for the USMLE Step 1: 2010 20th Anniversary Edition  | location = USA  | publisher = McGraw-Hill  | year= 2010  | page = 123  | isbn = 978-0-07-163340-6 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes these postnatal closures are incomplete or absent. The vessels or [[anastomosis|cross-connections]] remain open ([[wikt:patent#Adjective|patent]]), leading to the following conditions: 
* [[Atrial septal defect#Patent foramen ovale|Patent foramen ovale]] in the heart
* [[Patent ductus arteriosus]] in the [[great vessels]]
* [[Ductus venosus#Patent ductus venosus|Patent ductus venosus]] in the great vessels

In addition to differences in circulation, the developing fetus also employs a different type of oxygen [[Transport protein|transport molecule]] in its [[hemoglobin]] from that when it is born and breathing its own oxygen. [[Fetal hemoglobin]] enhances the fetus' ability to draw oxygen from the placenta. Its [[oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve]] is shifted to the left, meaning that it is able to absorb oxygen at lower concentrations than adult hemoglobin. This enables fetal hemoglobin to absorb oxygen from adult hemoglobin in the placenta, where the oxygen pressure is lower than at the lungs. Until around six months' old, the human infant's hemoglobin molecule is made up of two [[Hemoglobin, alpha 1|alpha]] and two [[HBG1|gamma chain]]s (2α2γ). The gamma chains are gradually replaced by [[HBB|beta chain]]s until the molecule becomes [[hemoglobin A]] with its two alpha and two beta chains (2α2β).

==Physiology==
The core concept behind fetal circulation is that fetal [[hemoglobin]] (HbF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Edoh D, Antwi-Bosaiko C, Amuzu D |title=Fetal hemoglobin during infancy and in sickle cell adults|journal=African Health Sciences|date=March 2006|volume=6|issue=1|pages=51–54| pmc=1831961|pmid=16615829}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a higher affinity for oxygen than does adult hemoglobin, which allows a diffusion of oxygen from the mother's circulatory system to the fetus.

===Blood pressure===
It is the fetal heart and not the mother's heart that builds up the fetal blood pressure to drive its blood through the fetal circulation.

Intracardiac pressure remains identical between the right and left ventricles of the human fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Johnson P, Maxwell DJ, Tynan MJ, Allan LD|title=Intracardiac pressures in the human fetus|journal=Heart|year=2000|volume=84|issue=1|pages=59–63|issn=0007-0769|doi=10.1136/heart.84.1.59|pmid=10862590|url=http://heart.bmj.com/content/84/1/59.full|pmc=1729389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blood pressure in the fetal aorta is approximately 30 mmHg at 20 weeks of gestation, and increases to ca 45 mmHg at 40 weeks of gestation.&lt;ref name=Struijk&gt;{{cite journal |pages=673–81 |doi=10.1002/uog.6137 |title=Blood pressure estimation in the human fetal descending aorta |year=2008 |last1=Struijk |first1=P. C. |last2=Mathews |first2=V. J. |last3=Loupas |first3=T. |last4=Stewart |first4=P. A. |last5=Clark |first5=E. B. |last6=Steegers |first6=E. A. P. |last7=Wladimiroff |first7=J. W. |journal=Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=32 |issue=5 |pmid=18816497}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fetal [[pulse pressure]] is ca 20 mmHg at 20 weeks of gestation, increasing to ca 30 mmHg at 40 weeks of gestation.&lt;ref name=Struijk/&gt;

The blood pressure decreases when passing through the placenta. In the [[arteria umbilicalis]], it is ca 50 mmHg. It falls to 30 mmHg in the capillaries in the villi. Subsequently, the pressure is 20&amp;nbsp;mm Hg in the umbilical vein, returning to the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/fplacenta/circulplac01.html |title=Fetal and maternal blood circulation systems |publisher=Swiss Virtual Campus |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flow===
The blood flow through the umbilical cord is approximately 35 mL/min at 20 weeks, and 240 mL/min at 40 [[weeks of gestation]].&lt;ref name=kiserud2004&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pd.1062 |title=The fetal circulation |year=2004 |last1=Kiserud |first1=Torvid |last2=Acharya |first2=Ganesh |journal=Prenatal Diagnosis |volume=24 |issue=13 |pages=1049–59 |pmid=15614842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adapted to the weight of the fetus, this corresponds to 115 mL/min/kg at 20 weeks and 64 mL/min/kg at 40 weeks.&lt;ref name=kiserud2004/&gt; It corresponds to 17% of the [[combined cardiac output]] of the fetus at 10 weeks, and 33% at 20 weeks of gestation.&lt;ref name=kiserud2004/&gt;

[[Endothelin]] and [[prostanoid]]s cause [[vasoconstriction]] in placental arteries, while [[nitric oxide]] causes [[vasodilation]].&lt;ref name=kiserud2004/&gt; On the other hand, there is no neural vascular regulation, and catecholamines have only little effect.&lt;ref name=kiserud2004/&gt;

==Prenatal heartbeat==
{{Main|Heart development}}
{{See also|Persistent fetal circulation}}

''Fetal cardiac activity'' (also called ''fetal heartbeat'' and usually called ''[[embryo]]nic cardiac activity'' before approximately 10 weeks of [[gestational age]]) is the rate of contractions during the [[cardiac cycles]] of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]]. The heart is not fully developed when cardiac activity becomes visible.

In cases of [[early pregnancy bleeding]], the detection of cardiac activity is the main finding that distinguishes a viable pregnancy from a [[silent miscarriage]].

'''Konami's Ping Pong''' is a [[sports game|sports]] [[arcade game]] created in 1985 by [[Konami]]. The game is notable as the first [[video game]] to accurately reflect the gameplay of [[table tennis]], as opposed to earlier simplifications like ''[[Pong]]''. As with other Konami titles of the time, it was ported to several [[8-bit]] computer systems and video game consoles.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Konami Ping Pong.png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]
''Konami's Ping Pong'' can be played singleplayer or multiplayer, using 11 point scoring rules; the first player to attain a score of 11 or higher, leading by two points, wins the game (to a maximum of 14-14, at which point the next point wins). The player must win the best of two out of three games in order to beat the match. The playfield is shown from an isometric perspective with the players shown as disembodied hands; players placed on the far-side of the table will find hitting the ball is much more difficult.{{Original research inline|date=July 2009}} However, the player is always positioned on the near side during the [[single player]] mode. All the essential moves are represented: forehand, backhand, lob, and smash.

==Trivia==
The game features the [[penguin]] [[protagonist]] from Konami's earlier title ''[[Antarctic Adventure]]'' on the [[title screen]] and as a member of the audience in the game. This penguin would be later be known as Penta. In the introductory animation, a pingpong ball bounces along the table, and finally hits Penta on the head, who appears to faint.

==Ports==
In 1985 the game was released by Konami for [[MSX]] computers and in 1986 the game was ported to the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] by [[Imagine Software]] and [[Bernie Duggs]], under the name ''Ping Pong''. Apart from scaled-down graphics and sound due to limited system capabilities, the ports perfectly replicate the arcade gameplay.

In 1987 the game was ported to the [[Famicom Disk System]] as ''Smash Ping Pong'' and published by [[Nintendo]]. Nintendo's character Donkey Kong Jr. replaces Konami's Penta in the crowd. [[Diskun]], a Famicom Disk System Mascot, also replaces Pentarou in a title screen.  It was later re-released on the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan and the PAL region (the latter got this as an import game under the title ''Smash Table Tennis'').

''Smash Ping Pong'' is slated for release on the [[Nintendo 3DS]], and may feature camera support, 3D support, or analog support. This release was featured amongst other games from the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Super NES]] to be released for the 3DS on a tech demo called ''Classic Games'' at [[E3 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;http://kotaku.com/5566935/mega-man-2-yoshis-island-among-teased-3ds-sorta+remakes&lt;/ref&gt;

''Konami's Ping Pong'' was made available on [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] ''[[Game Room]]'' service for its [[Xbox 360]] console and for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows-based]] [[personal computer|PC]]s in June 2010.

The '''Colorado Street Bridge''' is a historic [[concrete]] [[arch bridge]] spanning the [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]] in [[Pasadena, California]].

== History ==
The Colorado Street Bridge was designed and built in 1912 at a total cost of $191,000 ({{inflation|US|191,000|1914|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://ladailymirror.com/2013/06/17/mary-mallory-hollywood-heights-pasadenas-colorado-street-bridge-celebrates-100th-anniversary/ | title = Pasadena’s Colorado Street Bridge Celebrates 100th Anniversary | date = 17 June 2013 | accessdate = 4 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge was designed by the firm of [[Waddell &amp; Harrington]], based in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]]. The structure carries [[Colorado Boulevard]] (then called &quot;Colorado Street&quot;), the major east-west thoroughfare connecting Pasadena with [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] and [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] to the west, and with Monrovia to the east. Colorado Street Bridge replaced the small Scoville bridge located near the bottom of the Arroyo Seco. It opened on December 13, 1913.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-14/local/me-1686_1_colorado-street&lt;/ref&gt;

The bridge follows a curved path so that the footings would sit on more solid ground than a straight bridge would have provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/colorado-street-bridge/|title=The Complicated Case of the Colorado Street Bridge|last=Segal|first=Matthew|date=2018-06-18|website=Los Angeles Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/route66/colorado_street_bridge_pasadena.html|title=Colorado Street Bridge—Route 66: A Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. National Park Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bridge spans 1,486 feet (453&amp;nbsp;m) at a maximum height of 150 feet (45&amp;nbsp;m) and is notable for its distinctive [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] arches, light standards, and railings. The bridge is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and has been designated a [[List of historic civil engineering landmarks#United States landmarks|National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]].

=== &quot;Suicide Bridge&quot; ===
[[File:ScovilleBridgepartiallyColoradoStreetBridge.jpg|thumb|right|A 1913 view of the Scoville Bridge next to the partially completed Colorado Street Bridge.]]

During the early part of the twentieth century, the Colorado Street Bridge became known locally as &quot;[[Suicide bridge|Suicide Bridge]]&quot; after dozens of people leaped to their deaths.  The bridge had a bad reputation before it was even built, as a construction worker fell to his death and landed in the wet cement under the bridge.  Supposedly he is still there today.  The number of deaths spiked during the Great Depression but didn't stop there.

The most told story is about a woman and her child.  One night, the mother took her child and herself to the bridge and was ready to end her life.  She threw her baby first and then jumped, plummeting to her death.  The child survived, as it landed in a tree unharmed, but the mother successfully ended her life.

The [[balustrade]] was replaced by an 8 foot tall barrier in an effort to deter suicides, but the bridge retained its nickname. To this day, some still use the bridge as a means to end their lives. For example, on October 27, 2015, British-American model and reality television star [[Sam Sarpong]] committed suicide by jumping from the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sam-sarpong-spent-7-hours-talking-police-apparent-suicide-20152910]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, temporary anti-suicide barriers, in the form of 10 foot tall chain link fencing was installed on the sidewalk, inside the balustrade, blocking the seating alcoves. These alcoves are believed to be the primary route taken by suicide victims. In 2017, there were nine deaths by suicide. In 2018, there were four deaths by suicide from the bridge by September. After police spent 13 hours successfully negotiating with a would-be jumper, these temporary barrier fences were extended to cover the entire bridge span. The city plans to replace the temporary fencing with permanent barriers, at least 7.5 feet in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://www.pasadenaweekly.com/2018/09/06/latest-suicide-attempt-prompts-city-manager-to-expand-fencing-on-colorado-street-bridge/ | title = Latest suicide attempt prompts city manager to expand fencing on Colorado Street Bridge | date = 6 September 2018 | accessdate = 19 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/2018/09/04/pasadena-is-extending-temporary-fencing-on-colorado-street-bridge-to-deter-suicide-attempts/ | title = Pasadena is extending temporary fencing on Colorado Street Bridge to deter suicide attempts | date = 4 September 2018 | accessdate = 19 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In culture ==

In the 1970s, the bridge was a filming location of the TV series ''[[Emergency!]]'' fifth season (episode 14)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0570718/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl | title = Emergency! &quot;To Buy or Not to Buy&quot; (#5.14) }}&lt;/ref&gt; where a boy was shown trapped (the bridge was given the fictitious name Johnson Canyon Bridge in the episode).{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}}  In 1989, after the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] in [[Northern California]], the bridge was declared a seismic hazard and closed to traffic. It was reopened in 1993 after a substantial [[Seismic retrofit|retrofit]]. The bridge is closed each summer for a festival, &quot;A Celebration on the Colorado Street Bridge&quot;, hosted by historic preservation group Pasadena Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coremg.net/newspapers.php?paper=arcadiaweekly&amp;storyid=1065 Pasadena Heritage Presents a Celebration on the Colorado Street Bridge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512023045/http://www.coremg.net/newspapers.php?paper=arcadiaweekly |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An episode from the [[Full House (season 8)|eighth season]] of the series ''[[Full House]]'', &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; featured the bridge in a [[bungee jumping]] scene. The bridge was depicted as being in the [[San Francisco]] bay area.

The 2012 ''[[Lana Del Rey]]'' song ''[[Summertime Sadness]]'' for the album ''[[Born To Die]]'' filmed parts of its music video on the bridge. Actress Jaime King is seen climbing over a section of the bridge and then jumping off later in the video.

The bridge was site of the beginning of ''[[The Amazing Race (U.S. TV series)|The Amazing Race]]'' [[The Amazing Race 21|season 21]].  The contestants had to rappel down the side of the bridge to their waiting cars to start the race.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}}

In the 2016 romantic musical film [[La La Land (film)|''La La Land'']], the protagonists took an evening stroll across the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan Rane, [http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/los-angeles-travel-la-la-land-film-locations Did you love 'La La Land'?

'''Savas Dimopoulos''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɒ|p|ə|l|ɒ|s}}; {{lang-el|Σάββας Δημόπουλος}}; born 1952) is a [[particle physicist]] at [[Stanford University]]. He worked at [[CERN]] from 1994 to 1997. Dimopoulos is well known for his work on constructing theories [[beyond the Standard Model]].

==Life==
He was born an ethnic [[Greeks|Greek]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] and later moved to [[Athens]] due to ethnic tensions in Turkey during the 1950s and 1960s.

==Education and career==
Dimopoulos studied as an undergraduate at the [[University of Houston]].  He went to the [[University of Chicago]] and studied under [[Yoichiro Nambu]] for his doctoral studies.  After completing his Ph.D. in 1979, he briefly went to [[Columbia University]] before taking a faculty position at [[Stanford University]] in 1980. During 1981 and 1982 he was also affiliated with the [[University of Michigan]], [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. From 1994 to 1997 he was on leave from Stanford University and was employed by [[CERN]].

Dimopoulos is well known for his work on constructing theories [[beyond the Standard Model]], which are currently being searched for and tested at [[particle collider]]s like [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] at CERN and at experiments all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charitos|first1=Panos|last2=Papageorgiou Koufidou|first2=Athena|title=Interview with Savas Dimopoulos|url=http://ph-news.web.cern.ch/content/interview-savas-dimopoulos|website=PH: Newsletter of the PH department|publisher=CERN}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1981 he proposed a [[softly broken]] [[Special unitary group|SU]](5) GUT model with [[Howard Georgi]], which is one of the foundational papers of the [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model]] (MSSM). He also proposed the [[ADD model]] of [[large extra dimension]]s with [[Nima Arkani-Hamed]] and [[Gia Dvali]].

==Awards==
In 2006, the [[American Physical Society]] awarded Dimopoulos the [[Sakurai Prize]], &quot;For his creative ideas on dynamical symmetry breaking, [[supersymmetry]], and extra spatial dimensions, which have shaped theoretical research on TeV-scale physics, thereby inspiring a wide range of experiments.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;APS Physics, &quot;[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?name=Savas%20Dimopoulos&amp;year=2006 2006 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics Recipient]&quot; (accessed July 21, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Faces and places: APS honours particle physicists|journal=CERN Courier|date=June 2006|volume=46|issue=5|page=42|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1733932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he received the [[Tomassoni awards|Caterina Tomassoni and Felice Pietro Chisesi Prize]] at the University of Rome, Italy. &quot;The prize recognizes and encourages outstanding achievements in physics. Dimopoulos was lauded by the Tomassoni Committee as &quot;one of the leading figures in theoretical particle physics. His proposal of the supersymmetric standard model has aided the understanding of high-energy physics mechanisms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/april26/ppl-042606.html|title=Stanford News Honors and Awards|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared in the 2013 documentary film ''[[Particle Fever]]'', about the work of the [[Large Hadron Collider]].

'''''The Crime at Black Dudley''''', also known in the United States as '''''The Black Dudley Murder''''', is a [[Crime fiction|crime novel]] by [[Margery Allingham]], first published in 1929, in the United Kingdom by [[The Jarrold Group|Jarrolds]], London and in the United States by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday Doran]], New York. It introduces [[Albert Campion]], her misleadingly vapid detective, who would go on to appear in another 18 novels and many short stories over the next 30 years.

==Plot introduction==
A house party is under way at the remote Black Dudley, and among the guests are some very shady characters. As they merrily recreate the ritual of the Black Dudley Dagger, Colonel Coombe dies. [[Pathologist]] George Abbershaw suspects foul play, and when a vital item is mislaid, a gang of crooks hold the guests hostage. Will they escape the house – what did happen to the Colonel – and just who is the mysterious Mr Campion?

==Plot summary==

The story begins as the guests assemble for dinner on the first night of a house party. Black Dudley is a remote, ancient and sprawling manor house with a long and complex history, its numerous changes of use resulting in plenty of hidden rooms and secret passages. The pile is owned by the family of Wyatt Petrie, a popular young academic, and inhabited by his uncle by marriage, Colonel Coombe, a sickly recluse who wears a mask to cover unsightly scars. The bulk of the guests are young friends of Petrie – among them our red-headed hero George Abbershaw, pathologist and occasional consultant to [[Scotland Yard]], and similarly flame-haired Meggie, whom he shyly admires. The Colonel's medic Doctor White Whitby, and two of his associates, a shifty Englishman named Gideon and an imposing but silent foreigner going by the name of Benjamin Dawlish, are also present. So is one Albert Campion, garrulous and affable, but, George soon learns, unknown to either Petrie or the Colonel.

After dinner, the guests notice a sinister, bejewelled [[dagger]] hanging above the fireplace; Petrie tells them a story of its ancient origins in the family, and mentions a ritual involving the dagger being passed from hand to hand round the darkened house. The guests are keen to play the game, so the servants are dismissed, the lights extinguished and the ritual begins.

Abbershaw, not excited at the prospect of people waving daggers around in the dark, slips outside to check on his car; in the garage, he finds the mysterious Mr Campion loitering around. Admiring the Colonel's ancient car, they find it has been converted to contain a powerful [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] engine. The two head back into the house to see the end of the game, and find Meggie in a state of shock. The knife was handed to her at some point, and then snatched away again, but not before she realised the blade was covered in blood.

When the lights are finally restored, they hear the Colonel has fallen ill and has been taken to bed. The party breaks up for the night, but as George prepares for bed he is visited by Prenderby, a young newly-qualified doctor, who has been shown Coombe's body and been asked by Doctor Whitby to sign forms allowing a rapid [[cremation]], but, nervous and suspicious, has refused. Abbershaw is next to be asked, and entering the room he at once pulls the sheet from the bed. Although there are no obvious signs of foul play, Abbershaw's experience tells him the man did not die of heart failure, as Whitby claims. Also, his mask has slipped, revealing an unmarked face beneath. Abbershaw is forced to sign the forms, but plans to [[telegram|wire]] London the next day, to delay the cremation until a proper investigation can be carried out.

Later that night, the house is woken by loud noises, and they find Campion fighting wildly with one of the servants. Abbershaw finds a leather case on the ground, which he later opens, burning the document it contains and secreting the case. He talks with Meggie and her friend Anne, finding that Campion had met Anne in London, informed her he was invited to the party and got a lift down in her car.

The next day, Whitby and the chauffeur depart early with the body. At breakfast, the imposing Mr Dawlish makes a stark announcement – the cars have been drained of fuel, and no-one is to leave the house until something he has lost is returned to him. A brave young [[Rugby football|rugby]]-player attempts to escape in a car powered by alcohol, but is shot and wounded.

Campion, having mocked their captors, disappears, but later materialises, dusty and shaken, in Abbershaw's wardrobe. He tells them he has been roughly interrogated and locked up, but escaped through a secret passage, and also that he came to the house on a mission from an unknown, to collect an item from the Colonel and return to London with it. He retrieved the item, but was prevented from leaving by Abbershaw's presence in the garage, and then lost it in the fight with the chauffeur. He has also recognised the crooks, and names Dawlish as Eberhard von Faber, the head of a powerful criminal gang, one of the deadliest men in Europe.

Abbershaw hears that Meggie has been taken for questioning, and angered at the thought of the villains mistreating her, he uses Campion's passage to reach their lair. He too is questioned, and then locked up with Meggie. They speak to an eccentric servant locked up next door, and find that the criminals were as surprised as anyone at the Colonel's death. Campion releases them, and they form a plan to overpower the villains. After much fighting and danger, they retake the house, and are about to flee to safety when the chief villains return and recapture them.

Abbershaw reveals that he has burned their document, the plans for an audacious crime, and the party is locked upstairs, while the gang prepare to leave the house, leaving it on fire with the guests trapped inside. Just in time, the local [[Fox hunting|hunt]] ride by, with a friend of Campion's among them. Hearing the prisoners' cries for help, the hunt rides up, are incensed by the German's behaviour, and, as he tries to flee, cause his car to crash, crushing him.

The party breaks up and all return to London, where Campion impresses Abbershaw with the name of his mother before disappearing. Abbershaw, Prenderby and another man from the party find the converted car, and follow it to find Dr Whitby and the chauffeur about to flee the country by air. He denies killing the Colonel, and departs.

Abbershaw, after some thought and research, pays a visit to the killer – Petrie himself. Having fallen in love with a young girl, he found she was the puppet of evil criminals, and enraged by their treatment of her, he resolved to track them down. When he found his own uncle was one of them, he felt he had no choice but to slay him, inventing the dagger ritual to give him the chance. Abbershaw lets him go, on condition he enters a [[monastery]].

==Literary significance &amp; criticism==
The hero of ''The Crime at Black Dudley'' is George Abbershaw; Campion starts as a minor character, and grows far faster than the other characters do. This is most evident when Allingham takes time to explain when and why Abbershaw changes, while Campion's development seems to happen naturally.

Apparently, Allingham intended Abbershaw to be the hero/sleuth of this book and any future mysteries. He is, after all, a pathologist, and that could lead to many interesting stories. Campion got in the way and manages to become a far more memorable character, so much so that the American publishers strongly encouraged Allingham to focus on Campion.

Even in this first Campion novel, there are hints of his willingness to work outside the law. Though he and Scotland Yard are familiar with one another, it is clear that he is not working in any official capacity. Abbershaw had even encountered Campion before, although Campion was using a different name.

Campion's mysterious past is also brought out. He admits to using a number of names, and that Campion is not his real one (''[[Mystery Mile]]'' has more information). Campion goes so far as to mention the name of his mother to Abbershaw, who is struck speechless by the revealed name. Could he be one of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]'s illegitimate children? He never really hints at who his father was, and to British readers in the late 1920s the thought may have been natural.

If Campion was developed to poke fun at other sleuths, most notably [[Dorothy Sayers]]' [[Lord Peter Wimsey]], ''The Crime at Black Dudley'' shows a glimmer of a character that will stand very much on his own.

'''No. 200 Squadron''' of the [[Royal Air Force]] operated during the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]. The squadron was first formed in mid-1917 and during the First World War, it undertook a training role, before being disbanded in mid-1919. It was re-formed in 1941, and operated maritime patrol aircraft firstly from the United Kingdom, and then west Africa until early 1944 when it moved to India. In April 1945, the squadron was disbanded, having been renumbered [[No. 8 Squadron RAF]].

==First World War==
No. 200 Depot Squadron Royal Flying Corps was formed at East Retford on 1 July 1917, it operated the [[Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2]] in the night flying training role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halley&quot; /&gt;  It was disbanded on 13 June 1919 at the end of the war.{{Cn|date=March 2019}}

==Second World War==
The squadron was formed on 25 May 1941 from a section of [[No. 206 Squadron RAF]] at [[RAF Bircham Newton]] in [[Norfolk]], the first [[Lockheed Hudson]] [[patrol bomber]]s for the squadron arrived at the beginning of June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halley&quot; /&gt; Later in the month the squadron deployed to [[Gibraltar]] and then to the [[Gambia]], where it flew convoy protection missions out of [[Jeswang]], moving to [[Yundum]] in 1943 and re-equipping with the four-engined [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Consolidated Liberator VI]] bombers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halley&quot; /&gt;

Detachments of the squadron also flew from several other West African airfields in this period.{{Cn|date=March 2019}}

In March 1944, the squadron redeployed to [[Madras]] in India as part of South East Asia Command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halley&quot; /&gt;  It only carried out a few missions from Madras before moving to Bengal for special duties, mainly supplying and delivering guerilla parties into Burma and Malaya.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halley&quot; /&gt; In April 1945 it was renumbered as [[No. 8 Squadron RAF]] and 200 Squadron was disbanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halley&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jefford&quot; /&gt;

==Victoria Cross==
In August 1943, [[Flying Officer]] [[Lloyd Allan Trigg]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for an action in which his aircraft sank [[U-468]], a German [[submarine]]. Flying out of [[Banjul]], the Liberator V he piloted [[depth-charge]]d the submarine, taking heavy anti-aircraft fire in the process and crashing into the ocean with the loss of all crew. The only survivors of the engagement were seven German crewmen, who commended the bravery of the aircrew, making this one of the few Victoria Crosses to have been awarded on the recommendation of an enemy officer (and the sole VC to be awarded ''solely'' on enemy testimony).&lt;ref&gt;Ashcroft 2007, pp. 346–348&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ventilator-associated pneumonia''' ('''VAP''') is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are on [[mechanical ventilation]] breathing machines in hospitals.  As such, VAP typically affects critically ill persons that are in an [[intensive care unit]] (ICU).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michetti|first1=CP|last2=Fakhry|first2=SM|last3=Ferguson|first3=PL|last4=Cook|first4=A|last5=Moore|first5=FO|last6=Gross|first6=R|last7=AAST Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia|first7=Investigators|title=Ventilator-associated pneumonia rates at major trauma centers compared with a national benchmark: a multi-institutional study of the AAST|journal=The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery|date=May 2012|volume=72|issue=5|pages=1165–73|pmid=22673241|doi=10.1097/TA.0b013e31824d10fa}}&lt;/ref&gt; VAP is a major source of increased illness and death. Persons with VAP have increased lengths of ICU hospitalization and have up to a 20–30% death rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=D|title=Ventilator associated pneumonia: perspectives on the burden of illness.|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|date=2000|volume=26 Suppl 1|pages=S31–7|pmid=10786956|doi=10.1007/s001340051116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The diagnosis of VAP varies among hospitals and providers but usually requires a new infiltrate on chest x-ray plus two or more other factors. These factors include temperatures of &gt;38&amp;nbsp;°C or &lt;36&amp;nbsp;°C, a white blood cell count of &gt;12 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/ml, purulent secretions from the airways in the lung, and/or reduction in gas exchange.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koenig Steven M. |author2=Truwit Jonathon D. | date = October 2006 | title = Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention | url = | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 637–657 | doi=10.1128/cmr.00051-05|pmid=17041138 |pmc=1592694 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different less studied infection found in mechanically ventilated people is [[Tracheobronchitis|ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis]] (VAT).&lt;ref name=&quot;Craven&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Craven |first1=DE |last2=Chroneou |first2=A |last3=Zias |first3=N |last4=Hjalmarson |first4=KI |title=Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis: the impact of targeted antibiotic therapy on patient outcomes |journal=Chest |date=February 2009 |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=521–528 |doi=10.1378/chest.08-1617 |pmid=18812452}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with VAP, tracheobronchial infection can colonise the trachea and travel to the bronchi. VAT may be a risk factor for VAP.&lt;ref name=&quot;Craven&quot;/&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
People who are on mechanical ventilation are often sedated and are rarely able to communicate. As such, many of the typical symptoms of pneumonia will either be absent or unable to be obtained. The most important signs are [[fever]] or [[hypothermia|low body temperature]], new [[purulent]] [[sputum]], and [[hypoxemia]] (decreasing amounts of oxygen in the blood). However, these symptoms may be similar for tracheobronchitis.

==Cause==

=== Risk factors ===
Risk factors for VAP include underlying heart or lung disease, neurologic disease, and trauma, as well as modifiable risk factors such as whether the head of the bed is flat (increased risk) or raised, whether the patient had an [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration event]] before intubation, and prior antibiotic exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Patients who are in the ICU for head trauma or other severe neurologic illness, as well as patients who are in the ICU for blunt or penetrating trauma, are at especially high risk of developing VAP.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Further, patients hospitalized for blunt trauma are at a higher risk of developing VAP compared to patients with penetrating trauma.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis may be a risk factor for VAP, though not all cases of VAT progress to VAP.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abu-Salah&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abu-Salah |first1=T |last2=Dhand |first2=R |title=Inhaled antibiotic therapy for ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis and ventilator-associated pneumonia: an update |journal=Advances in therapy |date=September 2011 |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=728–47 |doi=10.1007/s12325-011-0051-z |pmid=21833701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microbiology ===
The microbiologic [[Flora (microbiology)|flora]] responsible for VAP is different from that of the more common [[community-acquired pneumonia]] (CAP). In particular, viruses and fungi are uncommon causes in people who do not have underlying [[immunocompromise|immune deficiencies]]. Though any microorganism that causes CAP can cause VAP, there are several bacteria which are particularly important causes of VAP because of their resistance to commonly used antibiotics. These bacteria are referred to as [[multidrug resistance|multidrug resistant]] (MDR).

:*''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is the most common MDR [[Gram-negative]] bacterium causing VAP. ''Pseudomonas'' has natural resistance to many antibiotics and has been known to acquire resistance to every antibiotic except for [[polymyxin B]]. Resistance is typically acquired through upregulation or mutation of a variety of efflux pumps which pump antibiotics out of the cell. Resistance may also occur through loss of an outer membrane porin channel ([[OprD]])
:*''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' has natural resistance to some [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s such as [[ampicillin]]. Resistance to [[cephalosporins]] and [[aztreonam]] may arise through [[Enzyme induction and inhibition|induction]] of a [[plasmid]]-based extended spectrum [[beta-lactamase]] (ESBL) or plasmid-based [[ampC]]-type [[enzyme]]
:*''[[Serratia marcescens]]'' has an ampC [[gene]] which can be induced by exposure to antibiotics such as cephalosporins. Thus, culture sensitivities may initially indicate appropriate treatment which fails due to bacterial response.
:*''[[Enterobacter]]'' as a group also have an inducible ampC gene. Enterobacter may also develop resistance by acquiring plasmids.
:*''[[Citrobacter]]'' also has an inducible ampC gene.
:*''[[Stenotrophomonas maltophilia]]'' often colonizes people who have tracheal tubes but can also cause pneumonia. It is often resistant to a wide array of antibiotics but is usually sensitive to [[co-trimoxazole]]
:*''[[Acinetobacter]]'' are becoming more common and may be resistant to [[carbapenem]]s such as [[imipenem]] and [[meropenem]]
:*''[[Burkholderia cepacia]]'' is an important organism in people with cystic fibrosis and is often resistant to multiple antibiotics
:*[[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] is an increasing cause of VAP. As many as fifty percent of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' isolates in the intensive care setting are resistant to methicillin. Resistance is conferred by the [[mecA]] gene.
:The development of [[Molecular diagnostics|molecular diagnostic]] techniques is changing the understanding of the microbiology of VAP, with an increasing appreciation of the role of hard to culture bacteria and the change in the [[Microbiota|lung microbiome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289540484|title=Lung Bacterial Population Diversity in CAP, VAP and Health using 16S rDNA Sequencing|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent finding has highlighted the presence of ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' in the lavage of patients with VAP, a finding which was largely absent from ventilated patients without VAP and healthy controls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nolan thoraxjnl–2015-208050&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nolan|first=T.

== Pathophysiology ==
It is thought by many, that VAP primarily occurs because the endotracheal or tracheostomy tube allows free passage of bacteria into the lower segments of the lung in a person who often has underlying lung or immune problems. Bacteria travel in small [[droplet]]s both through the endotracheal tube and around the cuff. Often, bacteria colonize the endotracheal or tracheostomy tube and are [[Embolism|embolized]] into the lungs with each breath. Bacteria may also be brought down into the lungs with procedures such as deep suctioning or [[bronchoscopy]]. Another possibility is that the bacteria already exist in the mucus lining the bronchial tree, and are just kept in check by the body's first line of defenses. Ciliary action of the cells lining the trachea drive the mucus superiorly, leading to a build-up of fluids around the inflated cuff where there is little to no airway clearance. The bacteria can then colonize easily without disturbance and then rise in numbers enough to become infective. The droplets that are driven into the airstream and into the lung fields are lofted by way of Bernoulli's principle. There is also a condition called oxidative damage that occurs when concentrations of pure oxygen come into prolonged contact with cells and this damages the cilia of the cells, thus inhibiting their action as part of the body's first line of defense.

Whether bacteria also travel from the [[Paranasal sinus|sinuses]] or the stomach into the lungs is, as of 2005, controversial. However, spread to the lungs from the [[blood stream]] or the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] is uncommon.

Once inside the lungs, bacteria then take advantage of any deficiencies in the [[immune system]] (such as due to [[malnutrition]] or [[chemotherapy]]) and multiply. Patients with VAP demonstrate impaired function of key immune cells, including the [[neutrophil]], both in the blood and in the alveolar space,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conway Morris|first=Andrew|last2=Kefala|first2=Kallirroi|last3=Wilkinson|first3=Thomas S.|last4=Dhaliwal|first4=Kevin|last5=Farrell|first5=Lesley|last6=Walsh|first6=Tim|last7=Mackenzie|first7=Simon J.|last8=Reid|first8=Hamish|last9=Davidson|first9=Donald J.|date=2009-07-01|title=C5a Mediates Peripheral Blood Neutrophil Dysfunction in Critically Ill Patients|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|volume=180|issue=1|pages=19–28|doi=10.1164/rccm.200812-1928OC|issn=1073-449X|pmc=2948533|pmid=19324972}}&lt;/ref&gt; with this impairment being driven by pro-inflammatory molecules such as [[Complement component 5a|C5a]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Andrew Conway|last2=Brittan|first2=Mairi|last3=Wilkinson|first3=Thomas S.|last4=McAuley|first4=Danny F.|last5=Antonelli|first5=Jean|last6=McCulloch|first6=Corrienne|last7=Barr|first7=Laura C.|last8=McDonald|first8=Neil A.|last9=Dhaliwal|first9=Kev|date=2011-05-12|title=C5a-mediated neutrophil dysfunction is RhoA-dependent and predicts infection in critically ill patients|journal=Blood|language=en|volume=117|issue=19|pages=5178–5188|doi=10.1182/blood-2010-08-304667|issn=0006-4971|pmid=21292772}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These defects in immune function appear to be casually linked to the development of VAP, as they are seen before clinical infection develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=A.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia is difficult and is not standardized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marino|first1=Paul L.|title=Marino's the ICU book|date=2014|isbn=978-1451121186|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria used for diagnosis of VAP varies by institution, but tends to be a combination of several of the following radiographic, clinical sign, and laboratory evidence:&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Pneumonia (Ventilator-associated [VAP] and non-ventilator-associated Pneumonia [PNEU]) Event |publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=January 2015|url = https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/pscmanual/6pscvapcurrent.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Temperature greater than 38 °C or less than 36 °C&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt;
# White blood cell count greater than 12,000/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or less than 4,000/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt;
# Purulent secretions, increased secretions, or change in secretions&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt;
# Positive tracheal cultures or bronchoalveolar lavage cultures&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt;
# Some sign of respiratory distress, such as shortness of breath, rapid breathing, abnormal breathing sounds when listening with stethoscope&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt;
# Increased need for oxygen on the ventilator&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt;
# Chest X-rays: at least two serial x-rays showing sustained or worsening shadowing (infiltrates or consolidations)&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt;
# Positive cultures that were obtained directly from the lung environment, such as from the trachea or bronchioles&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt;
 
As an example, some institutions may require one clinical symptoms such as shortness of breath, one clinical sign such as fever, plus evidence on chest xray and in tracheal cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt;

There is no gold standard for getting cultures to identify the bacteria, virus, or fungus that is causing the pneumonia, and there are invasive and non-invasive strategies for obtaining the culture sample.&lt;ref name=Berton2014&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berton|first=Danilo Cortozi|last2=Kalil|first2=Andre C.|last3=Teixeira|first3=Paulo José Zimermann|date=2014-10-30|title=Quantitative versus qualitative cultures of respiratory secretions for clinical outcomes in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=10|pages=CD006482|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006482.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=25354013|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One non-invasive strategy collects cultures from the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] of people with symptoms of VAP. Another is more invasive and advocates a [[bronchoscopy]] plus [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] (BAL) for people with symptoms of VAP. Both strategies also require a new or enlarging infiltrate on chest x-ray as well as clinical signs/symptoms such as fever and shortness of breath. There is no strong evidence to suggest that an invasive method to collect cultures is more effective than a non-invasive method.&lt;ref name=Berton2014 /&gt; In addition, a quantitative approach to assessing the culture (performing a bacterial count of the pathogen that is causing the pneumonia) does not appear to be superior to a qualitative approach (determining the presence of the pathogen).&lt;ref name=Berton2014 /&gt; In recent years there has been a focus on rapid diagnostics, allowing for detection of significant levels of pathogens before this becomes apparent on microbial cultures.

== Prevention ==
Prevention of VAP involves limiting exposure to resistant bacteria, discontinuing mechanical ventilation as soon as possible, and a variety of strategies to limit infection while [[tracheal intubation|intubated]]. Resistant bacteria are spread in much the same ways as any communicable disease. Proper [[hand washing]], [[sterile technique]] for invasive procedures, and isolation of individuals with known resistant organisms are all mandatory for effective infection control. A variety of aggressive weaning protocols to limit the amount of time a person spends intubated have been proposed. One important aspect is limiting the amount of sedation that a ventilated person receives.

Weak evidence suggests that raising the head of the bed to at least 30 degrees may help prevent VAP, however further research is required to understand the risks associated with this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Li|last2=Li|first2=Xiao|last3=Yang|first3=Zongxia|last4=Tang|first4=Xueli|last5=Yuan|first5=Qiang|last6=Deng|first6=Lijing|last7=Sun|first7=Xin|date=2016-01-08|title=Semi-recumbent position versus supine position for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults requiring mechanical ventilation|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=1|pages=CD009946|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009946.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26743945|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Antiseptic mouthwashes such as [[chlorhexidine]] may also reduce the risk of VAP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hua|first1=F|last2=Xie|first2=H|last3=Worthington|first3=HV|last4=Furness|first4=S|last5=Zhang|first5=Q|last6=Li|first6=C|title=Oral hygiene care for critically ill patients to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=25 October 2016|volume=10|pages=CD008367|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008367.pub3|pmid=27778318|url=https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/oral-hygiene-care-for-critically-ill-patients-to-prevent-ventilatorassociated-pneumonia(853ede35-93d4-4b0a-ab8c-003f0c88da4b).html}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the evidence is mainly restricted to those who have undergone cardiac surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Klompas M, Speck K, Howell MD, Greene LR, Berenholtz SM | title=Reappraisal of routine oral care with chlorhexidine gluconate for patients receiving mechanical ventilation – systematic review and meta-analysis | journal=JAMA Intern Med | year=2014 |volume=174 | issue=5| pages=751–61 | doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.359 | pmid=24663255| last2=Speck | last3=Howell | last4=Greene | last5=Berenholtz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American and Canadian guidelines strongly recommend the use of supraglottic secretion drainage (SSD). Special tracheal tubes with an incorporated suction lumen as the EVAC tracheal tube form Covidien / Mallinckrodt can be used for that reason. New cuff technology based on polyurethane material in combination with subglottic drainage (SealGuard Evac tracheal tube from Covidien/Mallinckrodt)showed significant delay in early and late onset of VAP.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17872488&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lorente L, Lecuona M, Jiménez A, Mora ML, Sierra A |title=Influence of an endotracheal tube with polyurethane cuff and subglottic secretion drainage on pneumonia |journal=Am.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of VAP should be matched to known causative bacteria.  However, when VAP is first suspected, the bacteria causing infection is typically not known and broad-spectrum antibiotics are given ([[empiric therapy]]) until the particular bacterium and its sensitivities are determined.  Empiric antibiotics should take into account both the risk factors a particular individual has for resistant bacteria as well as the local prevalence of resistant microorganisms.  If a person has previously had episodes of pneumonia, information may be available about prior causative bacteria.  The choice of initial therapy is therefore entirely dependent on knowledge of local flora and will vary from hospital to hospital. Treatment of VAP with a single antibiotic has been reported to result in similar outcomes as with a combination of more than one antibiotics, in terms of cure rates, duration of ICU stay, mortality and adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arthur|first=Lauren E|last2=Kizor|first2=Russell S|last3=Selim|first3=Adrian G|last4=van Driel|first4=Mieke L|year=2016|title=Antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=10|pages=CD004267|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004267.pub4|pmid=27763732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk factors for infection with an MDR strain include ventilation for more than five days, recent hospitalization (last 90 days), residence in a [[nursing home]], treatment in a [[hemodialysis]] clinic, and prior antibiotic use (last 90 days).

Possible empirical therapy combinations include (but are not limited to):
* [[vancomycin]]/[[linezolid]] and [[ciprofloxacin]],
* [[cefepime]] and [[gentamicin]]/[[amikacin]]/[[tobramycin]]
* [[vancomycin]]/[[linezolid]] and [[ceftazidime]]
* [[Ureidopenicillin]] plus β-lactamase inhibitor such as [[piperacillin/tazobactam]] or [[ticarcillin/clavulanate]]
* a carbapenem (e.g., [[imipenem]] or [[meropenem]])

Therapy is typically changed once the causative bacteria are known and continued until symptoms resolve (often 7 to 14 days). For patients with VAP not caused by nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli (like Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) the available evidence seems to support the use of short-course antimicrobial treatments (&lt; or =10 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grammatikos AP, Siempos II, Michalopoulos A, Falagas ME |title=Optimal duration of the antimicrobial treatment of ventilator-acquired pneumonia |journal=Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=861–6 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19053899 |doi=10.1586/14787210.6.6.861 |last2=Siempos |last3=Michalopoulos |last4=Falagas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who do not have risk factors for MDR organisms may be treated differently depending on local knowledge of prevalent bacteria.  Appropriate antibiotics may include [[ceftriaxone]], [[ciprofloxacin]], [[levofloxacin]], or [[ampicillin/sulbactam]].

As of 2005, there is ongoing research into inhaled antibiotics as an adjunct to conventional therapy. [[Tobramycin]] and [[polymyxin B]] are commonly used in certain centres but there is no clinical evidence to support their use.

==Prognosis==
VAP occurring early after intubation typically involves fewer resistant organisms and is thus associated with a more favorable outcome. Because respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation is itself associated with a high mortality, determination of the exact contribution of VAP to mortality has been difficult. As of 2006, estimates range from 33% to 50% death in patients who develop VAP. Mortality is more likely when VAP is associated with certain microorganisms (''Pseudomonas'', ''Acinetobacter''), [[Bacteremia|blood stream infections]], and ineffective initial antibiotics. VAP is especially common in people who have [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS).

== Epidemiology ==
Between 8 and 28% of patients receiving mechanical ventilation are affected by VAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chastre J, Fagon JY |title=Ventilator-associated pneumonia |journal=Am. J. Respir.

'''Odanad''' ({{lang-ml|ഓടനാട്}}, ''[[ISO 15919|ōṭānāṭŭ]]'', also known as '''Onattukara''', '''Onad''', '''Kayamkulam''', '''Kallikoilon''' and '''Chirava Svaroopam''') was a feudal state in late medieval  [[Kerala]]. It was established in the 11th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;ekayam&quot;/&gt; and disestablished in 1746 when it became part of [[Travancore]] after [[Venad]] King [[Marthanda Varma]]'s northern expedition. At the time of its dissolution, it was composed of the present-day [[taluk]]s of [[Mavelikkara]], [[Karthikapally]], [[Chenganur]] in the [[Alappuzha district]] and [[Karunagapally]] in the [[Kollam district]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sadasivan129&quot;/&gt; In the 15th century, the capital of Odanad was moved from [[Kandiyoor-Muttom]], Mavelikkara to [[Eruva]] and [[Krishnapuram, Alappuzha|Krishnapuram]], near [[Kayamkulam]], which led to the state being called ''Kayamkulam''. After this shift, Kayamkulam became the commercial centre of Odanad, while Mavelikkara remained its cultural centre. Odanad was controlled by [[Nair]] lords, among whom the ruler of Kayamkulam was the most prominent.

Today, the region is better known as Onattukara, the name used for one of the many revenue villages included in the Mavelikkara taluk. The [[Sri Krishna Swamy Temple]] in Eruva, located two kilometres north of Kayamkulam, is one of the prominent establishments in Onattukara.

== Etymology ==
The word ''Odanad'' is a transliteration of the Malayalam word ''ഓടനാട്'', ''ōṭānāṭŭ'', which is a portmanteau of ''ഓട'', ''ōṭā'', meaning ''boat'', and ''നാട്'', ''nāṭŭ'', meaning ''land'', so ''Odanad'' means the ''land of boats''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ekayam&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekayamkulam.com/mycity.php?page_val=kayamkulam-dynasty|title=Kayamkulam Dynasty|accessdate=2014-02-15|deadurl=no|archivedate=2013-09-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907031343/http://ekayamkulam.com/mycity.php?page_val=kayamkulam-dynasty}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative hypothesis is that the first part of the word derives from ''ഓടമുള'', ''ōṭāmuḷa'', meaning ''[[bamboo]]'', and that ''Odanad'' means the ''land of bamboo''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ekayam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cfamOnat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfamavelikkara.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=66/|title=Onattukara|accessdate=2014-02-15|archivedate=15 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215202614/http://www.cfamavelikkara.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=66%2F|publisher=[[Raja Ravi Varma College of Fine Arts]]|location=Mavelikkara|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran]]'s [[Sanskrit]] work ''[[Mayura Sandesam]]'' describes Odanad as the ''land of vines''.

Mavelikkara, the capital of Odanad, is associated with [[Maveli]], the central figure in the festival of [[Onam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ekayam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sadasivan129&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Sadasivan|first=S. N.|date=2000-01-01|page=129|publisher=[[APH Publishing Corporation]]|title=[[A Social History of India]]|isbn=9788176481700|oclc=44811613|location=[[New Delhi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state was hence known as Onattukara (ഓണാട്ടുകര, ''ōṇāṭṭukara''), which translates to the ''land of Onam''.

The state was [[metonymy|metonymically]] referred to as ''Kayamkulam'' after the capital was moved to the city of [[Kayamkulam]].

== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2014}}

=== 11th &amp;ndash; 14th century ===
[[Indian copper plate inscriptions#Copper plates of Kerala|Copper plate inscriptions in Thiruvalla]], dated to the 11th century, mention Odanad and Mattom, then its capital. These inscriptions, along with the ''[[Unnuneeli Sandesam]]'', also note the significance of [[Chennithala]] whips in Odanad.

Most of the records of the rulers of Odanad come from the temple records of the Kandiyoor Sree Mahadeva Temple.

{{expand section|date=February 2014}}

=== 15th &amp;ndash; 18th century ===
In 1743, Odanad was bordered by the feudal states of [[Kingdom of Pandalam|Pandalam]], [[Thekkumkur]], [[Elayadath]], [[Vadakkumkur]], [[Purakkad]] and [[Thrikkunnapuzha]], according to records left by [[Julius Valentin van Gollenesse]], [[Commander of Malabar|Commander]] of [[Dutch Malabar]] at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;galletti&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=A.|last=Galletti|title=The Dutch in Malabar|publisher=[[Government of Madras]]|year=1911|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924023942828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Odanad was demarcated from Vadakkumkur by the southern road from the [[Kandiyoor Sree Mahadeva Temple]], which formed Odanad's western border with Madathumkur. The eastern half of the temple was under the jurisdiction of Vadakkumkur, while the western half was in Odanad.

Following the annexation of Quilon by King [[Marthanda Varma]] of the newly established [[Travancore|Kingdom of Travancore]], Odanad organised a confederacy to liberate Quilon and restore its ruler. The Northern Alliance of Odanad, Purakkad, [[Vadakkumkur]], and [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]] succeeded in retaking Quilon and restoring its ruler. When the ruler of Quilon died in 1734, Odanad claimed the territory by virtue of adoption and immediately took possession of it. Travancore still claimed Quilon for itself and war broke out in 1739. The Queen of Elayadath, restored by the [[Dutch Empire]], attacked Travancore from the east, while Odanad moved in from the north and the Dutch landed in the south. Travancore made quick work of the untrained levies of Elayadath and, turning south, inflicted a crushing defeat on the Dutch in the [[Battle of Colachel]]. After failing to hold the [[Kilimanoor Fort]] in 1742, the forces of Odanad were chased back to the walls of their capital. The defeated ruler signed a separate peace agreement, the [[Treaty of Mannar]], according to which Odanad became a tributary of Travancore and ceded it more than half of its territories.

By 1746, Odanad had been persuaded by the Dutch to take up the leadership of a new confederation which included [[Kingdom of Chembakassery|Chembakassery]], Thekkumkur and Purakkad. In this fourth war between the states, Odanad was again defeated and its territories finally annexed to Travancore.&lt;ref name=&quot;namboothiri&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namboothiri.com/articles/naaduvaazhikal.htm|last=Pandarakalam|first=James Paul|location=Calicut|title=Namboothiri Rulers - Ambalapuzha Namboothiri Royalty - Unearthing a God-centered Kingdom|publisher=Namboothiri Websites Trust Calicut|accessdate=2014-02-16|deadurl=no|archivedate=2013-10-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022181125/http://namboothiri.com/articles/naaduvaazhikal.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chettikulangara Temple ====
The [[Chettikulangara Devi Temple]] in [[Chettikulangara]], Mavelikkara is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Chettikulangara Amma, who is considered as the mother goddess of Onattukara. It is believed to have been consecrated by [[Padmapadacharyar]], a disciple of [[Adi Shankara]], on the [[Uthrattathi]] day of [[Makaram|Makara month]] in AD 823. The goddess worshipped here is believed to have been a [[family deity]], and later emerged as the [[village deity|village]] and then the [[regional deity]]. Local historians oppose the argument that the temple is not as ancient as the nearby Kandiyoor Sree Mahadeva Temple or [[Mavelikkara Krishna Swamy Temple]] and Kannamangalam  Mahadeva Temple as it had not been mentioned in the ''Unnuneeli Sandesam''.  written in the 14th century. Also, there is no mentioning of the temple in the British survey records. According to late Kandiyoor Mahadeva Shasthri, [[Samudra Bandhan]], a leading courtier of Ravi Varman, an ancient King of Venad had visited this temple and wrote poems on Bhagavathi. They also hold that Aadithya Kulasekharan, the King of Venad (1374 to 1389) had also visited the Chettkulangara temple.

The mythology surrounding the temple has it that after [[Parasurama]] created Kerala. He had established 108 [[Durga]] temples, 108 [[Shiva temple]]s, numerous [[Shasta (deity)|Sastha]] temples, besides 108 [[Kalari]]s (place to learn traditional martial arts in front of the deity), [[Shakthi Kendra]]s and five Ambalayas, one of which was [[Jagadambika of Chettikulangara]], the Goddess of Odanad. The myth behind the temple's origin is related to clash between local landlords and it is clearly mentioned in the kuthiyotta pattu. The actual paradevatha dtas built by Kayamkulam Rajas (king). Lord Krishna is the Aradhana Moorthy (worship) of kayamkulam rajas. Makaram Festival one of the largest festivals in middle travencore. This festival is celebrated in 10 days (ulsavam). The seventh and eighth days festivals are very important. 7-ulsavam celebrated in temple's west region (padinjare kara) and 8-ulsavam celebrated in temple's east region (kizhakke kara). Eruva Sreekrishna's Arattukulam is one of biggest ponds in middle kerala. The Valiya Kakkanadu Madom near to Eruva Sree Krishna swamy temple is famous for the Gandharva temple, warriors who trained the military arts for odanadu army and army heads of King belonged to this family.

The ancient temple at the place Evoor is in the Onattukara region. This temple had originated in the presence of Bhagavan Sri Krishna himself.

This temple is one of the most important 26 Maha-Vishnu shrines in the world. The myth is linked to ‘Khandava-dahanam’ (burning of Khandava forest), described in ‘Mahabharata’. The remains of burnt trees being widely found here, confirm this. Further evidence are, nearby Mannarassala and ‘Pandavarkavu’ temples. (The research conducted by the archeology dept. of Kerala reveals that the fossils remains found in the fields near to the temple are not burned one. The forest cover fell down centuries back due to excessive sea level increase and flooding the area under sea. Carbon dating is also done to determine the time period.)

The great Kanva Maharshi (one of the top 7 Rishis), had been living in this part of Onattukara. ‘Kannamangalam’ (Kanva-mangalam) is nearby. His ‘Ashramam’ (hermitage) later became a temple. Evoor Krishnaswamy's yearly ‘Arattu’ (ceremonial bath) is held in this temple's tank.

===== Origin =====
According to local mythology, [[Agni]] deva, the Hindu god of fire, had been suffering from a severe stomach ailment. As a remedy, Lord Brahma advised him to consume the herb-rich [[Khandava Forest]]. The forest was home to serpent-king Takshaka, a close friend of [[Lord Indra]]. Whenever Agni tried to consume the forest, Lord Indra's thundershowers dutifully extinguished the fire.

Agni appeared in the form of a [[brahmin]] to seek the help of [[Krishna]] and [[Arjuna]], who were visiting the area. They set up a fire to consume the forest. Maharshi [[Kanva]] arrived to save his ‘Archa Murti’. a four armed image of [[Vishnu]]. Krishna granted a boon that the [[murti]] would not be harmed by fire. Soon, Agni started consuming Khandava Forest. Lord Indra used thundershowers promptly but on Krishna's advice, Arjuna constructed a canopy of arrows to prevent the rain from disrupting Agni's consumption of the forest. Thus Agni's ailment was cured.

As a sign of thankfulness, Agni sought permission to install that murti in a new temple there to facilitate worship. As instructed by Krishna, Arjuna fired an arrow to determine the location. A new temple was soon consecrated where the arrow had landed. Evoor is the shortened form of 'Eytha ooru', meaning the place from where the arrows were showered to make the canopy of arrows. Krishna infused his divine power into the murti and Arjuna performed its first [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]. A murti of [[Bhootha Natha Swamy]] ([[Kiratha Murti]] form of Lord Siva), together with [[Yakshi Amma]] (Devi [[Parvati]]) were consecrated as the sub-deities. The ancient trees roofing them are the survivors of Khandava Forest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evoortemple.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Fire and re-construction =====
In the 1880s, the temple was destroyed in a fire. When the ‘Sree Kovil’ (sanctum sanctorum) was caught fire, so many people tried to remove the Deity, but failed. At last, an old Brahmana-devotee of the adjacent house, after taking a dip in the temple tank, entered the raging flames and brought out the Deity, safely.

Sri [[Moolam Thirunal]], then king of Travancore, was in [[Varanasi|Kasi]] at that time. Appearing as a Brahmana-boy in his dream, Sri Krishna asked the king to re-construct the Evoor temple. Immediately, the king returned home and constructed a huge temple complex. It contained royal facilities such as security trenches atop the roof all around and underground drainage network to discharge the ‘abhishka water’ from ‘Srikovil’ to adjacent temple tank.

The renowned ‘Tharananalloor Tantri‘ (whose ancestor had been brought to Kerala by Sri Parashurama) was appointed as the traditional ‘Tantri’. Immense wealth (including lands and other assets) was arranged to ensure self-reliance. Also, extensive neighbourhood facilities and all necessary infrastructure were put in place for the temple.

===== Prayoga Chakra Prathishta =====
Evoor Bhagavan's Deity is the unique Prayoga Chakra Prathishta. Live ‘Sudarshana Chakra’ in rear right hand; Panchjanya Sankha in rear left hand; Butter in frontal right hand; and the frontal left hand is held on the hip as a ''mani-bandham''.

Bhagavan is in a combative mood ready to release ‘Sudarshana Chakra’. He is the 72-year-old Sri Krishna at His peak glory and power.

Vedic experts have confirmed the extremely rare divine presence of “Sri Chakra” on this deity. Consequently, “Raktha-pushpanjali” is a special offering here which is unavailable in Vishnu temples elsewhere.

Evoor temple is popularly known as the “Guruvayoor of Onattukara”.

Evoor temple is situated near the Cheppad Railway station between Kayamkulam and Harippad. The railway line is called the &quot;Theera Desa&quot; (coastal route which is not the main railway route). It is easier to reach there by bus. Cheppad is about 7&amp;nbsp;km north of Kayamkulam bus stand. From Harippad Bus stand Evoor is about 5&amp;nbsp;km south. You can get down at Cheppad Junction and go by an auto-rickshaw to Evoor temple. Alternatively, one can get down at the bus stop (south of Cheppad and north of Ramapuram Devi temple) on NH-47 and walk up to the temple which is about 1&amp;nbsp;km east of NH-47.

Mavelikkara was once a flourishing centre of Buddhist culture,&lt;ref name=&quot;ucan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucanindia.in/diocesan-directory/home/diocese/trivandrum/39|title=Short History of Trivandrum Diocese|accessdate=2014-02-16|archivedate=2013-07-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731084422/http://www.ucanindia.in/diocesan-directory/home/diocese/trivandrum/39|publisher=[[Union of Catholic Asian News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an ancient Buddha statue currently raised in Mavelikkara town, at Buddha Junction in front of the Krishnaswamy temple, was excavated more by accident in the early 1900s from a paddy field near the Kandiyoor temple. It is possible that a lot more of the vanished Buddhist civilisation of Onnattukara still lies buried in history, yet to be unearthed. Names of towns and villages in the Onattukara region carry the ''palli'' suffix, which was common usage in [[Pāli]], the language of [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Karunagapalli, Karthikapalli, Pallickal, Pallippuram, Puthupalli are examples of such historical and present names of places in the Onattukara region. The Portuguese had a factory in Odanadu in the 16th century, but Odanad was the earliest ally of the Dutch in Malabar..

*In all seriousness, you really don't have a sense of humor.  This was only put up for fun and to see if it would last.  It was obvious from the beginning that it wasn't going anywhere.  I don't even know why it's still up.  In other news, Saberwyn clearly indicated that it shows potential to be a 'real' article, which goes against all the other's proclamations that it is a cut and dry removal piece.

**''May''. The key word is ''may''. I originally did not believe personally that there was potential in this article. Mind you, my judgement is hampered in this case because I live on a different continent. I was only stating the possibility that someone who knew the place better that I did (and wasn't an original contributor to the article) could possibly have looked at the piece and given the rest of us informed advice. Jacqui has given us that informed decision, and I see no evidence here to counter her claims.
::If there was any desire by the original contributors to make this into a decent article (which there apparently wasn't according to the comment above) that effort has been completely blown out of the water by the behaviour of the article's contributors and their allies during this AfD. Mind you, some of the accusations by the regualar users are almost as bad.
::I've made my decision. I'm no longer abstaining, now voting for '''delete''' as a serious failure of [[WP:CORP]], and also as a breach of the spirit of the [[Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point]] policy, as attested to above by anon user 209.81.166.99.

*Well, Well, Well.  Looks like we gots ourselves a bunch of retarted moderators here.  Seen um before I have.  Yup, they go around getting a sick high off deleting enjoyable articles.  Yeah, them some nasty buggers.  They pretend to be high n' mighty while striking down the weak and unedumicated. Bastards.  Nope, you just can't get rid of them. They hang around like flies on dead bodies.  We can only pray that someday, maybe, they will understand harmless humor, and find something better to do with their time.  But for now, we all must put up with their stank.
* '''Comment''' Very cute...
*Does anyone know anything about calculus?  I'm having a hard time with one of my homework problems and I was hoping someone could help me out.  The problem reads:  We are planning to put a space shuttle in gepsynchronous orbit at a distance above the earth`s equator of 22, 300 miles. It`s objective is a point in space 240,000 miles from the earth`s center. We know that the best time to leave earth`s orbit is a little more than 3/4 of an orbit past the point,C, which is the closest point in the shuttle`s orbit to the object, M, However, we need a bit more accuracy that that. A) How long from the time when it is closest to the objective, M, should it fire its rockets so as to be on a direct course toward the objective? B) How fast will the shuttle be traveling toward the objective just before firing the rockets to leave earth orbit. The picture given has earth inside of this larger circle. The point C is directly below E on the circle and the point S, is directle to the left and down, like at 280 degrees on the circle. I know that: you have to use the radius of the earth, divide by 24 to get how fast the space shuttle travels in one hour, and that the circle is the orbit of the shuttle. I would really appreciate your help. Thanks for taking time out to help.

'''Lybster''' ({{lang-gd|Liabost}}) is a village on the east coast of [[Caithness]] in northern [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gittings |first1=Bruce |last2=Munro |first2=David |title=Lybster |url=https://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townfirst5089.html |website=The Gazetteer for Scotland |publisher=School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh and The Royal Scottish Geographical Society |accessdate=7 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once a big [[herring]] fishing port, but has declined in recent years, due to problems in the industry.

==History==
It hosts the &quot;World Championships of [[Knotty]]&quot;; knotty or ''cnatag'' is a variant of [[shinty]].

The film, ''[[The Silver Darlings]]'', from [[Neil Gunn]]'s book, was shot here.

The [[Clan Sinclair|Sinclairs]] of Lybster have long roots running back to the Sinclair earls who ruled Caithness that was once a much larger area taking in much of Sutherland. Tracing further back the family has connections to the Norwegian earls who controlled the north of Scotland for centuries.

[[Lybster railway station]] was part of the [[Wick and Lybster Railway]]. It opened on 1 July 1903 and closed on 3 April 1944.

Lybster's sister city is [[Mackinac Island]], U.S.A.

==Patrick Sinclair==
One of the more famous of the clan was [[Patrick Sinclair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Armour |first1=David A. |title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |date=1983 |publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/sinclair_patrick_5E.html|volume=5 |accessdate=7 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today there is a pub on [[Mackinac Island]] that bears his name. Ironically it is an Irish pub.

[[File:Posada2.Catrina.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|''La Calavera Catrina'']]
[[File:Calavera_garbancera.png|thumb|[[José Guadalupe Posada|Posada's]] ''La Calavera Garbancera'' in 1913]]
'''''La Calavera Catrina ''''' ('Dapper Skeleton', 'Elegant Skull') or '''''Catrina''''' '''''La Calavera Garbancera''''' is a 1910&amp;ndash;1913 [[zinc]] [[etching]] by the Mexican printmaker, cartoon illustrator and [[lithographer]] [[José Guadalupe Posada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;artoftheprint&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/posada_jose_guadalupe_calaveracatrina.htm|title=Jose Guadalupe Posada, Calavera Catrina (Dapper Skeleton)|publisher=ArtofthePrint.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is offered as a satirical portrait of those Mexican natives who, Posada felt, were aspiring to adopt European aristocratic traditions in the pre-revolution era. ''La Catrina'' has become an icon of the Mexican Día de Muertos, or [[Day of the Dead]].

The zinc etching depicts a female skeleton dressed only in a hat, her ''chapeau en attende'' is related to European styles of the early 20th century. The original leaflet describes a person who was ashamed of their indigenous origins and dressed imitating the French style while wearing lots of makeup to make their skin look whiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mexican-folk-art-guide.com/catrina.html|title=La Catrina|work=Copal, Mexican Folk Art at its best Online.|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This description also uses the word ''garbancera'', a nickname given to people of indigenous ancestry who imitated European style and denied their own cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=&quot;rockypoint360&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rockypoint360.com/la-catrina-the-woman-of-mexico|title=La Catrina – The woman of Mexico|date=2012-10-30|work=Rocky Point 360|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorklatinculture.com/catrina/|title=Catrina La Calavera Garbancera is the icon of Día de los Muertos|date=2018-09-25|work=New York Latin Culture Magazine|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural importance ==
&quot;La Catrina has become the referential image of Death in Mexico, it is common to see her embodied as part of the celebrations of Day of the Dead throughout the country; she has become a motive for the creation of handcrafts made from clay or other materials, her representations may vary, as well as the hat.&quot; – J.G. Posada&lt;ref name=&quot;rockypoint360&quot; /&gt;

While the original work by Posada introduced the character, the popularity of La Calavera as well as her name is derived from a work by artist [[Diego Rivera]] in his 1947 completed mural ''[[Sueño de una Tarde Dominical en la Alameda Central]]'' ''(Dream of a Sunday afternoon along Central Alameda)''.

Rivera's mural was painted between the years 1946 and 1947, and is the principal work of the &quot;Museo Mural Diego Rivera&quot; adjacent to the Alameda in the historic center of [[Mexico City]]. It measures 15 meters long and it stood at the end of Alameda Park. The mural survived the 1985 earthquake, which destroyed the Del Prado hotel, and was later moved across the street to the [[Museo Mural Diego Rivera]], built after the earthquake for the purpose of housing and displaying Rivera's restored mural.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate&quot; &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/mexico/mexicomix/article/La-Catrina-Mexico-s-grande-dame-of-death-2318009.php|title=La Catrina: Mexico's grande dame of death|first1=Christine|last1=Delsol|first2=Special to|last2=SFGate|date=25 October 2011|website=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic subtext ==

=== Image ===
[[File:Chapala181.JPG|thumb|upright|Figures by Michoacan artisan Emilio Barocio Yacobo at the 2015 ''Feria de los Maestros del Arte'' in [[Chapala, Jalisco]]]]
Rivera's mural depicts a culmination of 400 years of Mexico's major figures, which include himself, Posada, and his wife [[Frida Kahlo]]. Rivera took inspiration from the original etching and gave Calavera a body as well as more of an identity in her elegant outfit as she is poised between himself and Posada. The intent seemed to be to show the tradition of welcoming and comfort the Mexicans have with death and especially the identity of a [[Santa Muerte|Lady of the Dead]], harking back to the heritage of the Aztec goddess [[Mictecacihuatl]].  As explained by [[curator]] David de la Torre from the [[LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes]], a [[Mexican-American]] museum and cultural center in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], US, Catrina has come to symbolize not only [[Día de Muertos]] and the Mexican willingness to laugh at death itself, but originally Catrina was an elegant or well-dressed woman, so it refers to rich people,&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate&quot; /&gt; de la Torre said. &quot;Death brings this neutralizing force; everyone is equal in the end. Sometimes people have to be reminded of that.&quot;

=== Culture ===
The culture of La Calavera has ties to political satire and is also a well-kept tradition as the original was inspired by the polarizing reign of dictator [[Porfirio Díaz]]. Díaz is lauded for modernizing and bringing financial stability to Mexico, but he also led his government in repression, corruption, and excess, and had an apparent obsession with European materialism and culture. Christine Delsol writes: &quot;Concentration of fantastic wealth in the hands of the privileged few brewed discontent in the hearts of the suffering many, leading to the 1910 rebellion that toppled Diaz in 1911 and became the Mexican Revolution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate&quot; /&gt;

=== Social Classes ===
She also symbolizes the contrasts between the upper and lower classes, for times were cruel. The social classes were extremely segmented and the highest class was the most fortunate, enjoying many privileges; in contrast, the lower classes were nearly invisible. To explain and rescue the folklore of honoring the memory of those who have died, while showing this off to high society, José Guadalupe Posada made caricatures of Death, one of these drawings being the famous Calavera with an elegant hat, though only representing the head and bust with a sophisticated and skeletal essence.&lt;ref name=&quot;rockypoint360&quot; /&gt;

== Links to Mesoamerica ==

=== Aztecs ===
The calavera's ties to the past heritage of the Aztecs can be seen in various ways. The indigenous culture of skulls and the death-goddess [[Mictecacihuatl]] is common in [[pre-Columbian art]]. Lady of the Dead, Mictecacihuatl, was keeper of the bones in the underworld, and she presided over the ancient month-long Aztec festivals honoring the dead. Since the [[pre-Columbian era]], Mexican culture has maintained a certain reverence towards death,&lt;ref name=&quot;peña&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Araujo Peña |first=Sandra Alejandro |author2=Barbosa Ramírez Marisela |author3=Galván Falcón Susana |author4=García Ortiz Aurea |author5=Uribe Ordaz Carlos |title=El culto a la Santa Muerte: un estudio descriptivo |trans-title=The cult of Santa Muerte:A descriptive study |journal=Revista Psichologia |publisher=Universidad de Londres |location=Mexico City |url=http://www.udlondres.com/revista_psicologia/articulos/stamuerte.htm |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be seen in the widespread commemoration of the [[Day of the Dead]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MRamirez&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title='Saint Death' comes to Chicago |first=Margaret |last=Ramirez |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/death-chicago-08,0,2114588.story |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Christian beliefs superimposed on the ancient rituals, those celebrations have evolved into today's Day of the Dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate&quot; /&gt;

=== Spain ===
As for the Spanish heritage (the death-orientation of the [[monastic orders]], [[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]], and ''[[memento mori]]'' traditions), it blended with the average Mexican's stoic, but far from humorless, view of death.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Some find La Catrina to have closer ties to the Dance of Death than to the possible origins of the calavera in the art of ancient Mesoamerica. La Calavera differs markedly from the rigid sobriety of skulls carved by the Aztec or images of decomposing corpses depicted by the ancient Maya. In prints and various other art forms associated with the Day of the Dead—everything from papier-mâché to papel picado (perforated paper) to sugar and chocolate—images of the calavera are unmistakably humorous. The skeletons, often dressed in finery, move playfully and smile widely. In some ways, these animated figures are much closer visually to the European Dance of Death motif in which limber skeletons lead, lure, or drag unwitting mortals to their ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/124/index.html|title=Art Through Time: A Global View - La Calavera de la Catrina|website=www.learner.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
Though these interpretations seem to ignore the full relationship that the Mexicans have with death, as well as the macabre humor that ties to the cycle of life, death and ceremony that the Aztecs had, it should be understood that few countries pay homage to death the way Mexico does; offerings, songs, respect and humor are all common Mexican expressions towards death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celebra.aollatino.com/2010/11/01/what-does-death-mean-for-mexicans/|title=Yahoo!|website=celebra.aollatino.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European ties are there both for comic effect as well as depicting the symbolic shell that Europe cloaked Mesoamerica in, but the native bones still lie within.

== Folk art ==

=== Purist ===
La Calavera Catrina today can be found in her more traditional form both in drawn works as well as sculptures made out of Oaxacan wood carvings, papier-mâché sculptures, majolica pottery, and [[Barro negro pottery|Barro negro black clay pottery]]. She is also coupled with male skeletons.

== Costume ==
Dressing as a &quot;Catrina&quot; is a popular costume in [[Day of the Dead]] celebrations in Mexico. Catrinas typically feature &quot;[[Calavera#Face painting|sugar skull]]&quot; make-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allure.com/story/dia-de-los-muertos-makeup-tradition|title=5 Things to Know Before Doing Dia de Los Muertos Makeup|last=Devash|first=Meirav|work=Allure|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* Works such as the screen print ''Sun Maid'' (''Raisins'') by [[Ester Hernandez|Ester Hernández]] in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] show the influence of Posada's earlier vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2.americanart.si.edu/education/corazon/galeria_06.cfm|title=¡Del Corazón! / American Art|website=2.americanart.si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same might be said of the cover for [[Los Lobos]]' album ''[[La pistola y el corazón]]'', which depicts a pistol toting Catrina in a couple's embrace.

* A character based on La Calavera appears as a protagonist in the 2014 computer-animated film ''[[The Book of Life (2014 film)|The Book of Life]]'', where she is named &quot;[[Santa Muerte|La Muerte]]&quot; and is the queen of the deceased who are remembered by the living. She is referred to in the Latin American Spanish dub as &quot;La Catrina&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2262227/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv |title=The Book of Life (2014 film), Trivia |publisher=[[IMDb.com]] |quote=In the Spanish dubbing of the movie, La Muerte is called &quot;La Catrina&quot;, this is obviously &quot;Posada's Catrina&quot; a popular iconic skeletal lady that has become associated with the festivities of the Día de Muertos. Her main attribute is a gorgeous hat. In the movie, the modern Mexican icon (La Catrina) and the classic icon (Lady Death), are fused in a single role as the ancient Mayan goddess of death, ruling over one of the lands of the dead.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See footnote.''

* Two educational video series, ''La Calavera'' and ''La Calavera: El úlitmo secreto'', were filmed in Mexico by [[Pearson Education]], and include various program components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PS1lMm&amp;PMDBSOLUTIONID=6724&amp;PMDBSITEID=2781&amp;PMDBCATEGORYID=811&amp;PMDBSUBSOLUTIONID=&amp;PMDBSUBJECTAREAID=&amp;PMDBSUBCATEGORYID=23498&amp;PMDbProgramId=6142&amp;elementType=programComponents|title=AP Honors and Electives Curriculums and Textbooks - Pearson|website=www.pearsonschool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both videos integrate language proficiency with culture, and follow the journey of Jamie González as she searches for the secrets of her mysterious great-grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PS1lMm&amp;PMDbSiteId=2781&amp;PMDbSolutionId=6724&amp;PMDbSubSolutionId=&amp;PMDbCategoryId=811&amp;PMDbSubCategoryId=23498&amp;PMDbSubjectAreaId=&amp;PMDbProgramId=6142|title=AP Honors and Electives Curriculums and Textbooks - Pearson|website=www.pearsonschool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the [[MMORPG]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', during the first and second days of November, a Day of the Dead Celebration is held among the largest Capital Cities of the game. Each city has a Calavera, represented as a dancing female undead NPC dressed in a mariachi outfit. If the player dances with her, his or her player character will also take the appearance of an undead character with a similar outfit.

* In the ''[[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]]'', creatures called Calaveras painlessly welcome into the afterlife those who cannot accept death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/863052391|title=Pathfinder roleplaying game : Bestiary 4|last=Stephen.|first=Radney-MacFarland,|last2=K.|first2=Reynolds, Sean|last3=Dennis.|first3=Baker,|last4=Alexandur.|first4=Alexandrov,|last5=Jason.|first5=Bulmahn,|last6=Gary.|first6=Gygax,|last7=1947-2009.|first7=Arneson, Dave,|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Paizo Pub|isbn=9781601255754|oclc=863052391}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar in appearance to La Catrina, wearing a festive dress and carrying a bouquet of flowers.

* The video game ''[[Need for Speed: Payback]]'' features a crew leader by the name of &quot;La Catrina&quot; as the leader of her crew &quot;Graveyard shift&quot; and one of the first bosses you encounter. Her motto says &quot;When you ride a Hundred Miles an hour, Every decision is Life and Death&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ea.com/games/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-payback/street-leagues/graveyard-shift|title=Graveyard Shift - Street Leagues - Need for Speed Payback|first=Electronic|last=Arts|date=8 November 2017|website=www.ea.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''John H. Stevenson''', a native of [[New York City]], was appointed Volunteer Acting Assistant Paymaster and Clerk in the [[United States Navy]] on 19 September 1862. His Civil War career was marked by several exploits of exceptional heroism.

While attached to [[USS Satellite (1854)|USS ''Satellite'']] on the Potomac in December 1862, he led a boat expedition ashore, captured a small party of [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]], and destroyed signal and recruiting stations. In June 1863, while attached to [[USS Princess Royal|USS ''Princess Royal'']] on the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, he reconnoitered in and about an enemy camp. Learning the details of a plan to capture Fort [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana]], he made plans that enabled the small fort and ''Princess Royal'' to beat off the attack.

He further demonstrated his heroism on 10 July 1863 when he volunteered to pick up dispatches from [[USS New London|USS ''New London'']], aground under enemy fire, and carried them to Farragut at New Orleans, a journey of some 85 miles on horseback through enemy territory. He remained in the Navy after the war, serving in United States ports, the South Atlantic and Pacific stations, and at [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki, Japan]], until retiring with the grade of Pay Inspector on 25 September 1893. He was called back to active duty during the [[Spanish–American War]] and served as pay officer of the Coast Defense System. He died in [[Brooklyn, New York]], on 14 June 1899.

==Namesake==
The [[USS Stevenson (DD-645)|USS ''Stevenson'' (DD-645)]] is named in his honor.

===[[Mike McCue]]===
Not notable, probably vanity. [http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Mike+McCue%22+Freetown&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta= Google search] [[User:Rem120|Remy B]] 18:45, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

**'''Comment'''. This [http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%28%22Mike+McCue%22+OR+%22michael+mccue%22%29+Freetown&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=  google link] which searches for ''michael mccue'' as well as ''mike'' shows some more results, but is it notable enough? Does Wikipedia have an article about the youngest person elected in US history, doesn't appear so. Delete as not quite notable enough. -[[User:Amoffit|Andrew]] 15:32, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. My attempt to clean it up a bit edit conflicted with this nomination. The information is verifiable, if not notable. No vote. [[User:JPD|JPD]] [[User talk:JPD|(talk)]] 18:57, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
**Thanks for the cleanup, the reference definitely helps with determining the notability of the person. As for me, I think it definitely shows the person is not nearly notable enough to warrant an article. [[User:Rem120|Remy B]] 19:09, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
*'''Keep.'''  It wouldn't be notable except at the subject's age, this is very impressive.  At least here in America.  [[User:24.41.12.37|24.41.12.37]] 02:51, 1 November 2005 (UTC)


'''''Mike McCue''' ([[1986]]? - ) is an elected member of the Finance Committee in [[Freetown, Massachusetts]].''
:*'''No Vote/Comment.'''  I've been watching this since yesterday half-amused, half-surprised, and finding it altogether bizarre.  I'm going to refrain from voting, and please by no means think I'd be the least bit offended if it gets deleted; but as far as it being a vanity article, I wouldn't have had to guess at my own year of birth...  (it is 1986, tho, if anyone was remotely curious.  I haven't fixed it because I don't think it would be right for me to edit the article).  [[User:Sahasrahla|Sahasrahla]] 20:10, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

This is a '''list of courts in [[England and Wales]]'''. For information about the different types of court see [[Courts of England and Wales]].

==Civil courts==

The highest appellate court is the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], followed by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]. The highest court in which originating process may be issued is the [[High Court of England and Wales]]. The High Court is based at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London and in district registries elsewhere.

===County Court===
{{Main|List of County Court venues in England and Wales|List of former county courts in Wales}}
When the county court system was created as a result of the [[County Courts Act 1846]], there were 491 county courts in England and Wales.  Since the [[Crime and Courts Act 2013]] came into force, there has been one [[County Court (England and Wales)|County Court in England and Wales]], sitting simultaneously in many different locations.

==Criminal courts==

===Crown Court===
{{main|List of crown courts in England and Wales}}
The [[Crown Court]] deals with serious criminal charges and with less serious charges where the accused has elected trial at the Crown Court instead of trial at a [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]].  The Crown Court also hears appeals against conviction and sentence from magistrates.&lt;ref name=Stats/&gt;  There are 91 locations in England and Wales at which the Crown Court regularly sits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071204/text/71204w0025.htm | house=House of Commons | date=4 December 2007 | column_start=1179W | column_end=1181W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crown Court centres are designated in one of three tiers: first-tier centres are visited by [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|High Court judge]]s for criminal and also for civil cases (in the District Registry of the High Court); second-tier centres are visited by High Court judges for criminal work only; and third-tier centres are not normally visited by High Court judges.  High Court judges hear 2% of cases at the Crown Court, but 27% of the most serious (Class 1) cases. [[Circuit judge (UK)|Circuit judge]]s and [[recorder (judge)|recorder]]s sit at all three tiers, hearing 88% and 10% of the cases respectively. When the Crown Court is conducting a trial, the judge sits with a [[Jury (England and Wales)|jury]] of twelve; when hearing appeals from magistrates, the judge sits with two (or sometimes four) magistrates.&lt;ref name=Stats&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/judicial-court-stats-chapter6.pdf | title=Judicial and Court Statistics 2007, Chapter 6 | publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] | accessdate=2008-10-16 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001115612/http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/judicial-court-stats-chapter6.pdf | archivedate=2008-10-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown Court system was established by the [[Courts Act 1971]], which came into force on 1 January 1972, following the recommendations of a [[Royal Commission]] chaired by [[Lord Beeching]].  Previously, criminal cases that were not dealt with by magistrates were heard by [[assize court]]s and [[quarter sessions]] courts, in a system that had changed little in the preceding centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cases and Materials on the English Legal System | page=16| last=Zander | first= Michael| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year= 2007 | isbn= 978-0-521-67540-6 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=6LApn6-3S80C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22Crown+Court%22+category+1#PPA16,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Crown Court system is administered by [[Her Majesty's Courts Service]], an [[Executive Agency]] of the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]].  England is divided into six regions by HMCS (London, Midlands, North East, North West, South East and Western), with the whole of Wales forming a seventh region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/Framework_Document_Fina_Version_01-04-08.pdf |title=HMCS Framework Document |pages=2 |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Courts Service|HMCS]] |date=April 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081116221249/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/Framework_Document_Fina_Version_01-04-08.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 78 of the [[Supreme Court Act 1981]] provides that the Crown Court can conduct business at any location in England and Wales, in accordance with directions given by the [[Lord Chancellor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-t6RzJj71GMC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=%22crown+court%22+section+78+%22supreme+court+act%22 | title=Jackson's Machinery of Justice | year=1989 |last=Jackson| first= Richard Meredith |authorlink=R. M. Jackson|author2=Spencer, J. R.  |isbn=978-0-521-31767-2| publisher=Cambridge University Press | page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; This power is sometimes used to enable court sittings to take place away from one of the regular Crown Court venues. For example, in 2007, a sitting of the Crown Court was held at one of the oldest court buildings in England or Wales, the former courthouse in [[Beaumaris]], [[Anglesey]], which was built in 1614 and closed in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/6993909.stm |title=Historic court reopens for a day|publisher=BBC News|date=14 September 2007 | accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bishop Macdonell Catholic High School''' is a [[Catholic school#Canada|Catholic]] [[High school#Canada|high school]] located in the south end of [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It is one of the three high schools in the [[Wellington Catholic District School Board]], all of which are located within the city limits of Guelph.

== History ==
Originally, this school was located in downtown Guelph at the intersection of Cork and Norfolk Street, next to the Church of our Lady Immaculate.

The school's roots date from when the [[Sisters of Loretto|Loreto Sisters]], also known as the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, arrived from Toronto and opened a school for girls in 1856 (housed in the convent, the last remaining structure that is standing as part of the original school). The enrollment quickly increased, that in 1872 an addition was constructed. In 1883, it was decided that the younger grades would be moved to two other sites on the original property (St. Agnes school for girls - which is still standing and St. Stanislaus School for boys - which was rebuilt in 1977) and the convent school would continue to house the high school students. By 1926, enrolment was continuing to increase and the new Loretto Academy was built immediately next door the convent school, and the all-girls school continued to be operated by the Loretto sisters.

In 1953 the co-educational Notre Dame High School was erected, and at this time, laywomen and men joined the Sisters as part of the teaching staff. This building provided facilities for grades 9 and 10 and was infamous for its gymnasium and its &quot;caged gallery&quot;. On the other hand, Loretto Academy also became co-educational and housed students in grades 11, 12, and 13. In 1962, Loretto Academy and Notre Dame were renamed Bishop Macdonell Catholic High School, after Bishop [[Alexander Macdonell (Bishop)|Alexander Macdonell]] (1762–1840), a well-respected Catholic leader in his own time, and a few years later in 1966-1967, the two schools were officially joined by an addition.

In 1992, a report highlighting the needs of the Catholic community through a Board-School-Church committee, recommended the closure of the original high school and a recommendation of a school of the same name to be built in the future. Despite a long and hard-fought battle with support from many members of the community, the school was closed in June, 1995 and the three buildings, with the exception of the original 1856 convent building, were demolished in 2004.

In September 2004, the recommendation of the committee finally came forth as the existing school on Clair Road West opened starting with grades 9 through 11.  Grade 12 has since been added, thereby enabling full granting status of the [[Ontario Secondary School Diploma]], continuing the tradition of the Loretto Sisters and Celtic Pride in Guelph.

On June 16, 2009, Grade 9 student Isabel Warren was killed by a cinderblock wall collapsing on her in a washroom facility in Larry Pearson Park, which is located behind the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guelph Mercury&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.guelphmercury.com/News/article/496463 |title=Isabel Warren recalled as an athlete, painter and much more |publisher=[[Guelph Mercury]] |date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=June 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uniforms are a blue [[tartan]] [[kilt]], black dress pants, a golf shirt, and French cut white [[blouse]] for girls, and a [[golf shirt]] and black slacks for boys. The school's motto is &quot;Wisdom - Honour - Courage&quot;.

The '''''Saga of Cuckoo''''' is a series of [[science fiction]] novels by American writers [[Frederik Pohl]] and [[Jack Williamson]]. It consists of two novels, '''''Farthest Star''''' and '''''Wall Around a Star'''''.

The books feature an [[interstellar teleporter]] that leaves the original being behind and sends only a duplicate.  When a person is duplicated, the original can just pass out of the machine without a second thought.  The copies also can be &quot;edited&quot; at destination.

==''Farthest Star''==

''Farthest Star'' was published by [[Ballantine Books]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/p/frederik-pohl/farthest-star.htm&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[fix-up]] of the 1973 novella &quot;Doomship&quot; and the 1974 serial &quot;The Org's Egg&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?3512&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the novel, engineer Ben Charles Pertin is selected to be humanity's representative in a multi-race mission to reach &quot;Object Lambda&quot;, a mysterious object traveling towards the galaxy at 1/6th lightspeed. Since the object is still approaching, Ben and the others are transported to the probeship Aurora by a matter duplication transporter. While the original goes on with his life, the duplicate (Ben James) and his Companion, Doc Chimp, work with the rest of the beings to construct a faster drone to get a transporter in orbit of the object, racing against time as the ionizing radiation from the ship's fusion drive is slowly killing them. After a struggle, the drone is successfully launched, killing all on board.

The drone performs as planned and an orbiting habitat called Cuckoo Station is constructed. A new duplicate arrives, Ben Linc.

==''Wall Around a Star'' ==

{{main|Wall Around a Star}}

''Wall Around a Star'' was published by [[Del Rey Books]] on January 12, 1983. The cover art for the 1983 edition was done by [[David Burroughs Mattingly|David Mattingly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IBL&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iblist.com/book19581.htm  | title = Book Information: Wall Around a Star  | publisher = Internet Book List  | accessdate = 2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In this novel linguist Jen Babylon is called on to translate alien records which may explain the nature of &quot;Cuckoo&quot;, a sphere built around a star, and thus save the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickerson|first=Susan L|title=Wall Around a Star (book)|journal=Library Journal|date=1983-02-15|volume=108|issue=4|page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{History of Sudan}}
This article discusses the '''history''' of '''[[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]''' during the [[history of Sudan]] from 1899 to 1955. 

In January 1899, an [[British Empire|Anglo]]-[[Egypt]]ian agreement restored Egyptian rule in [[Sudan]] but as part of a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]], or joint authority, exercised by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Egypt]]. The agreement designated territory south of the twenty-second parallel as the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Although it emphasized Egypt's indebtedness to Britain for its participation in the reconquest, the agreement failed to clarify the juridical relationship between the two condominium powers in Sudan or to provide a legal basis for continued British governing of the territory on behalf of the [[Khedive]]. Article II of the agreement specified that &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;the supreme military and civil command in Sudan shall be vested in one officer, termed the Governor-General of Sudan. He shall be appointed by Khedival Decree on the recommendation of Her Britannic Majesty's Government and shall be removed only by Khedival Decree with the consent of Her Britannic Majesty's Government.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The British governor-general, who was a military officer, reported to the [[Foreign Office]] through its resident agent in [[Cairo]]. In practice, however, he exercised extraordinary powers and directed the condominium government from [[Khartoum]] as if it were a colonial administration. [[Reginald Wingate|Sir Reginald Wingate]] succeeded [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]] as governor-general in 1899. 

In each province, two inspectors and several district commissioners aided the British governor (''mudir''). Initially, nearly all administrative personnel were [[British Army]] officers attached to the [[Egyptian Army]]. In 1901, however, civilian administrators started arriving in the Sudan from Britain and formed the nucleus of the Sudan Political Service. Egyptians filled middle-level posts while Sudanese gradually acquired lower-level positions.

==Condominium period==

In the condominium's early years, the governor-general and provincial governors exercised great latitude in governing the Sudan. After 1910, however, an executive council, whose approval was required for all legislation and for budgetary matters, assisted the governor-general. 

The governor-general presided over this council, which included the inspector-general; the civil, legal, and financial secretaries; the General Officer Commanding the Troops (The Kaid);&lt;ref name = SudanStory&gt;Hyslop, J. (1952) : “The Sudan Story”, Chapter “The Avenger Brings Peace”, The Naldrett Press, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; and two to four other British officials appointed by the governor-general. From 1944 to 1948 there existed also an Advisory  Council for the Northern Sudan whose functions were advice and consultation.  This Advisory Council had 18 members representing Province Councils, 10 members nominated by the Governor-General and 2 honorary  members.&lt;ref name = Almanac&gt;Public Relations Department Sudan Government Khartoum  (1951) “Sudan Almanac 1951”, McCorquodale &amp; Co. (Sudan)&lt;/ref&gt; The executive council retained legislative authority until 1948. 

===Law and order===
After restoring order and the government's authority, the British dedicated themselves to creating a modern government in the condominium. Jurists adopted penal and criminal procedural codes similar to those in force in [[British Raj| British India]]. Commissions established land tenure rules and adjusted claims in dispute because of grants made by successive governments. Taxes on land remained the basic form of [[taxation]], the amount assessed depending on the type of [[irrigation]], the number of date palms, and the size of herds; however, the rate of taxation was fixed for the first time in Sudan's history. 

The 1902 [[Code of Civil Procedure]] continued the [[Ottoman Law| Ottoman]] separation of civil law and [[sharia]], but it also created guidelines for the operation of sharia courts as an autonomous judicial division under a chief [[qadi]] appointed by the governor general. Religious judges and other sharia court officials were invariably Egyptian. 

There was little resistance to the condominium. Breaches of the peace usually took the form of intertribal warfare or banditry. [[Mahdi]]st uprisings occurred in February 1900, in 1902-3, in 1904, and in 1908 but these revolts were of short duration. In 1916, [[Abd Allah as Suhayni]], who claimed to be the Prophet [[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]], launched an unsuccessful [[jihad]].

===Undefined borders===
The problem of the condominium's undefined borders was a greater concern. A 1902 treaty with [[Ethiopia]] fixed the southeastern boundary with Sudan. Seven years later, an Anglo-[[Belgium|Belgian]] treaty determined the status of the [[Lado Enclave]] in the south establishing a border with the [[Belgian Congo]] (present-day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). 

The western boundary proved more difficult to resolve. [[Darfur]] was the only province formerly under Egyptian control that was not soon recovered under the condominium. When the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdiyah]] disintegrated, Sultan [[Ali Dinar]] reclaimed Darfur's throne, which had been lost to the Egyptians in 1874 and held the throne under Ottoman suzerainty, with British approval on condition that he pay annual tribute to the khedive. When World War I broke out, Ali Dinar proclaimed his loyalty to the Ottoman Empire and responded to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]'s call for a jihad against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. Britain, which had declared a protectorate over Egypt in 1914, sent a small force against Ali Dinar, who died in subsequent fighting. In 1916, the British annexed Darfur to Sudan and terminated the Fur sultanate.

===Economic development===
During the co-dominium period, economic development occurred only in the [[Nile Valley]]'s settled areas. In the first two decades of condominium rule, the British extended telegraph and rail lines to link key points in northern Sudan but services did not reach more remote areas. Port Sudan opened in 1906, replacing [[Sawakin]] as the country's principal outlet to the sea. 

In 1911 the Sudanese government and the private Sudan Plantations Syndicate launched the [[Gezira Scheme]] (Gezira is also seen as Jazirah) to provide a source of high-quality cotton for Britain's textile industry. An irrigation [[Sennar Dam|dam near Sennar]], completed in 1925, brought a much larger area in [[Al Jazirah (state)|Al Jazirah]] under cultivation. Planters sent cotton by rail from Sannar to Port Sudan for shipment abroad. The Gezira Scheme made cotton the mainstay of the country's economy and turned the region into Sudan's most densely populated area.

==Egyptian independence, fate of Sudan==

In 1922, Britain renounced the protectorate and approved [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|Egypt's declaration of independence]]. However, the 1923 Egyptian constitution made no claim to Egyptian sovereignty over Sudan. Subsequent negotiations in London between the British and the new Egyptian government foundered on the Sudan question. 

Inflamed by the failure of the talks, nationalists rioted in Egypt and in Sudan where [[Ali Abd al Latif| a minority supported union]] with Egypt. In November 1924, Sir [[Lee Stack]], governor general of Sudan and Sirdar, was assassinated in Cairo. Britain ordered all Egyptian troops, civil servants, and public employees withdrawn from Sudan. In 1925, Khartoum formed the 4,500-man [[Sudan Defence Force]] (SDF) under Sudanese officers to replace Egyptian units.

===Indirect rule===
Sudan was relatively quiet in the late 1920s and 1930s. During this period, the colonial government favored [[indirect rule]], which allowed the British to govern through indigenous leaders. 

In Sudan, the traditional leaders were the shaykhs (of villages, tribes, and districts) in the north and tribal chiefs in the south. The British first delegated judicial powers to shaykhs to enable them to settle local disputes; then, gradually, they allowed the shaykhs to administer local government under the supervision of British district commissioners. The number of Sudanese recognizing these leaders and the degree of authority they wielded varied considerably. 

The mainstream of political development, represented by other local leaders and Khartoum's educated elite, disapproved of indirect rule. In their view, it prevented the country's unification, exacerbated tribalism in the north, and in the south served to buttress a less-advanced society against Arab influence. Indirect rule also implied government decentralization, which alarmed the educated elite who had careers in the central administration and envisioned an eventual transfer of power from British colonial authorities to their class.

Nationalists and the [[Khatmiyyah]] opposed indirect rule, but the [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]] (or followers of the Mahdi) supported the British approach since many of them enjoyed positions of local authority.

==Britain's policy towards the South==

From the beginning of the Anglo-Egyptian condominium, the British sought to modernize Sudan by applying European technology to its underdeveloped economy and by replacing its authoritarian institutions with ones that adhered to liberal English traditions. 

Southern Sudan's remote and undeveloped provinces&amp;mdash;Equatoria, [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr al Ghazal]], and Upper Nile&amp;mdash;received little official attention until after World War I, however, except for efforts to suppress tribal warfare and the slave trade. The British justified this policy by claiming that the south was not ready for exposure to the modern world. To allow the south to develop along indigenous lines, the British, therefore, closed the region to outsiders. As a result, the south remained isolated. A few Arab merchants controlled the region's limited commercial activities while Arab bureaucrats administered whatever laws existed. Christian missionaries, who operated schools and medical clinics, provided limited social services in southern Sudan. 

The earliest Christian missionaries were the [[Verona]] Fathers, a [[Roman Catholic]] religious order that had established southern missions before the Mahdiyah. Other missionary groups active in the south included [[Presbyterian]]s from the United States and the Anglican [[Church Missionary Society]]. There was no competition among these missions, largely because they maintained separate areas of influence. The government eventually subsidized the mission schools that educated southerners. Because mission graduates usually succeeded in gaining posts in the provincial civil service, many northerners regarded them as tools of British imperialism. The few southerners who received higher training attended schools in British East Africa (present-day [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and [[Tanzania]]) rather than in Khartoum, thereby exacerbating the north-south division. 

===&quot;Closed-door&quot; ordinances===
British authorities treated the three southern provinces as a separate region. The colonial administration, as it consolidated its southern position in the 1920s, detached the south from the rest of Sudan for all practical purposes. 

The period's &quot;closed door&quot; ordinances, which barred northern Sudanese from entering or working in the south, reinforced this separate development policy. Moreover, the British gradually replaced Arab administrators and expelled Arab merchants, thereby severing the south's last economic contacts with the north. The colonial administration also discouraged the spread of Islam, the practice of Arab customs, and the wearing of Arab dress. At the same time, the British made efforts to revitalize African customs and tribal life that the slave trade had disrupted. Finally, a 1930 directive stated that blacks in the southern provinces were to be considered a people distinct from northern Muslims and that the region should be prepared for eventual integration with [[British East Africa]]. 

Although potentially a rich agricultural zone, the south's economic development suffered because of the region's isolation. Moreover, a continual struggle went on between British officials in the north and south, as those in the former resisted recommendations that northern resources be diverted to spur southern economic development. Personality clashes between officials in the two branches in the Sudan Political Service also impeded the south's growth. 

Those individuals who served in the southern provinces tended to be military officers with previous Africa experience on secondment to the colonial service. They usually were distrustful of Arab influence and were committed to keeping the south under British control. By contrast, officials in the northern provinces tended to be Arabists often drawn from the diplomatic and consular service. Whereas northern provincial governors conferred regularly as a group with the governor general in Khartoum, their three southern colleagues met to coordinate activities with the governors of the British East African colonies.

==Rise of Sudanese nationalism==

Sudanese [[nationalism]], as it developed after World War I, was an Arab and Muslim phenomenon with its support base in the northern provinces. Nationalists opposed indirect rule and advocated a centralized national government in Khartoum responsible for both regions. Nationalists also perceived Britain's southern policy as artificially dividing Sudan and preventing its unification under an arabized and Islamic ruling class. 

Ironically, however, a non-Arab led Sudan's first modern nationalist movement. In 1921, [[Ali Abd al Latif]], a Muslim [[Dinka]] and former army officer, founded the [[United Tribes Society]] that called for an independent Sudan in which power would be shared by tribal and religious leaders. Three years later, Ali Abd al Latif's movement, reconstituted as the [[White Flag League]], organized demonstrations in Khartoum that took advantage of the unrest that followed Stack's assassination. Ali Abd al Latif's arrest and subsequent exile in Egypt sparked a mutiny by a Sudanese army battalion, the suppression of which succeeded in temporarily crippling the nationalist movement. 

In the 1930s, nationalism reemerged in Sudan. Educated Sudanese wanted to restrict the governor general's power and to obtain Sudanese participation in the council's deliberations. However, any change in government required a change in the co-dominium agreement. Neither Britain nor Egypt would agree to a modification. Moreover, the British regarded their role as the protection of the Sudanese from Egyptian domination. The nationalists feared that the eventual result of friction between the co-dominium powers might be the attachment of northern Sudan to Egypt and southern Sudan to Uganda and Kenya. Although they settled most of their differences in the 1936 [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Treaty of Alliance]], which set a timetable for the end of British military occupation, Britain and Egypt failed to agree on Sudan's future status. 

Nationalists and religious leaders were divided on the issue of whether Sudan should apply for independence or for union with Egypt. The Mahdi's son, [[Abd ar Rahman al Mahdi]], emerged as a spokesman for independence in opposition to [[Ali al Mirghani]], the Khatmiyyah leader, who favored union with Egypt. Coalitions supported by each of these leaders formed rival wings of the nationalist movement. Later, radical nationalists and the Khatmiyyah created the [[Ashigga]], later renamed the [[National Unionist Party]] (NUP), to advance the cause of Sudanese-Egyptian unification. The moderates favored Sudanese independence in cooperation with Britain and together with the Ansar established the [[National Umma Party Sudan|Umma Party]].

==The road to independence==
As World War II approached, the [[Sudan Defence Force]] assumed the mission of guarding the Sudanese frontier with [[Italian East Africa]] (present-day [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]). During the summer of 1940, in what became the first moves of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], Italian forces invaded the Sudan at several points and captured the railway junction at [[Kassala]] and other villages along the border. However, while [[Port Sudan]] was raided by irregular Eritrean forces in August 1940, the SDF prevented an Italian advance on the [[Red Sea]] port city. 

In January 1941, the SDF, expanded to about 20,000 troops, retook Kassala and participated in the Empire offensive that routed the Italians in Eritrea and liberated Ethiopia by the end of the year. Some Sudanese units later contributed to the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]'s successful [[North African Campaign]]. 

In the immediate postwar years, the co-dominium government made a number of significant changes. In 1942 the [[Graduates' General Conference]], a quasi-nationalist movement formed by educated Sudanese, presented the government with a memorandum that demanded a pledge of self-determination after the war to be preceded by abolition of the &quot;closed door&quot; ordinances, an end to the separate curriculum in southern schools, and an increase in the number of Sudanese in the civil service. The governor general refused to accept the memorandum but agreed to a government-supervised transformation of indirect rule into a modernized system of local government. Sir [[Douglas Newbold]], governor of [[Kurdufan Province]] in the 1930s and later the executive council's civil secretary, advised the establishment of parliamentary government and the administrative unification of north and south. In 1948, over Egyptian objections, Britain authorized the partially elected consultative Legislative Assembly representing both regions to supersede the advisory executive council. The Legislative Assembly had its own executive council consisting of five British and seven Sudanese members.&lt;ref name = SudanStory/&gt;  A number of elected local government bodies gradually took over the responsibilities of the former British local commissioner, starting with [[El Obeid]], the centre of the [[Gum arabic]] industry.  By 1952 it was reported that Sudan had 56 local self-governing authorities.&lt;ref name = SudanStory/&gt;

The pro-Egyptian NUP boycotted the 1948 Legislative Assembly elections. As a result, pro-independence groups dominated the Legislative Assembly. In 1952, leaders of the Umma-dominated legislature negotiated the Self-Determination Agreement with Britain. The legislators then enacted a constitution that provided for a prime minister and council of ministers responsible to a bicameral parliament. The new Sudanese government would have responsibility in all areas except military and foreign affairs, which remained in the British governor general's hands. Cairo, which demanded recognition of Egyptian sovereignty over Sudan, repudiated the co-dominium agreement in protest and declared its reigning monarch, [[Faruk]], king of Sudan. 

After seizing power in Egypt and overthrowing the Faruk monarchy in late 1952, Colonel [[Muhammad Naguib]] broke the deadlock on the problem of Egyptian sovereignty over Sudan. Cairo previously had linked discussions on Sudan's status to an agreement on the evacuation of British troops from the [[Suez Canal]]. Naguib separated the two issues and accepted the right of Sudanese self-determination. In February 1953, London and Cairo signed an Anglo-Egyptian accord, which allowed for a three-year transition period from co-dominium rule to self-government. During the transition phase, British troops would withdraw from Sudan. At the end of this period, the Sudanese would decide their future status in a plebiscite conducted under international supervision. Naguib's concession seemed justified when parliamentary elections held at the end of 1952 gave a majority to the pro-Egyptian NUP, which had called for an eventual union with Egypt. In January 1954, a new government emerged under NUP leader [[Ismail al-Azhari]].

==The south and the unity of Sudan==

During World War II, some British colonial officers questioned the economic and political viability of the southern provinces as separate from northern Sudan. Britain also had become more sensitive to Arab criticism of the southern policy. In 1946, the [[Sudan Administrative Conference]] determined that Sudan should be administered as one country. Moreover, the conference delegates agreed to readmit northern administrators to southern posts, abolish the trade restrictions imposed under the &quot;closed door&quot; ordinances, and allow southerners to seek employment in the north. Khartoum also nullified the prohibition against Muslim proselytizing in the south and introduced Arabic in the south as the official administration language. 

Some southern British colonial officials responded to the Sudan Administrative Conference by charging that northern agitation had influenced the conferees and that no voice had been heard at the conference in support of retaining the separate development policy. These British officers argued that northern domination of the south would result in a southern rebellion against the government. Khartoum therefore convened a [[Juba Conference (1947)|conference at Juba]] to allay the fears of southern leaders and British officials in the south and to assure them that a post-independence government would safeguard southern political and cultural rights. 

Despite these promises, an increasing number of southerners expressed concern that northerners would overwhelm them. In particular, they resented the imposition of Arabic as the official language of administration, which deprived most of the few educated English-speaking southerners of the opportunity to enter public service. They also felt threatened by the replacement of trusted British district commissioners with unsympathetic northerners. After the government replaced several hundred colonial officials with Sudanese, only four of whom were southerners, the southern elite abandoned hope of a peaceful, unified, independent Sudan. 

The hostility of southerners toward the northern Arab majority surfaced violently when southern army units mutinied in August 1955 to protest their transfer to garrisons under northern officers. The rebellious troops killed several hundred northerners, including government officials, army officers, and merchants. The government quickly suppressed the revolt and eventually executed seventy southerners for sedition. But this harsh reaction failed to pacify the south, as some of the mutineers escaped to remote areas and organized resistance to the Arab-dominated government of Sudan.

'''Baron Fermoy''' is a title in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]. This title was created by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] by [[letters patent]] of 10 September 1856 for [[Edmond Roche, 1st Baron Fermoy|Edmond Roche]]. Previous letters patent were issued on 14 May 1855 which purported to create the barony for Roche, but these were ruled invalid in 1856. Under the [[Acts of Union 1800]], three pre-1801 Irish peerages had to go extinct for each new Irish peerage created; the three extinct peerages cited in 1855 were Viscounts [[Viscount Melbourne|Melbourne]] and [[Viscount Tyrconnel|Tyrconnel]] and the [[Earl of Mountrath]]; the earldom went extinct [[Charles Coote, 7th Earl of Mountrath|in 1802]], but the [[subsidiary title]] [[Baron Castle Coote]] passed by [[special remainder]] and remained current until 1827. The [[Committee for Privileges]] of the [[House of Lords]] reasoned that the number of peerages had reduced in 1802, but the number of peers had not, and so the 1855 patent was incompatible with the terms of the Act of Union. The 1856 patent substituted [[Viscount O'Neill]] for Earl of Mountrath and was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Fermoy Peerage Claim |last1=Macdonell |first1=John |last2=Wallis |first2=John Edward Power |title=Reports of state trials |date=1888 |publisher=Eyre and Spottiswoode for HMSO |location=London |pages=723–786 |chapterurl=https://archive.org/details/reportsstatetri01wallgoog/page/n389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first baron represented [[Cork County (UK Parliament constituency)|County Cork]] and [[Marylebone (UK Parliament constituency)|Marylebone]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], taking the [[Chiltern Hundreds]] the day the spurious 1855 patent was issued. He also served as [[Lord Lieutenant of County Cork]]. His younger son, the third Baron, sat as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Kerry East (UK Parliament constituency)|Kerry East]]. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baron. He notably represented [[King's Lynn (UK Parliament constituency)|King's Lynn]] in Parliament. {{As of|2017}} the title is held by his grandson, the sixth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1984. The first baron was named after his relative [[Edmund Burke]] and are descended from the [[House of Burke]]. 

[[Diana, Princess of Wales]], was a great-great-granddaughter of the first Baron Fermoy through her mother, [[Frances Shand Kydd]]. Shand Kydd was the younger daughter of the [[Maurice Roche, 4th Baron Fermoy|4th Baron Fermoy]], a friend of [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] and the elder of the twin sons of the American heiress [[Frances Work]] and her first husband, the Hon.

A '''triazole''' refers to any of the [[heterocyclic compound]]s with [[molecular formula]] C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, having a five-membered ring of two carbon atoms and three nitrogen atoms. There are two sets of [[isomer]]s that differ in the relative positions of the three nitrogen atoms. Each of these has two [[tautomer]]s that differ by which nitrogen has a hydrogen bonded to it:

2H-1,2,3-Triazole Structural FormulaV.1.svg|2''H''-1,2,3-Triazole
&lt;/gallery&gt;
*[[1,2,4-Triazole]] 
&lt;gallery perrow=&quot;2&quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot;&gt;
1H-1,2,4-Triazole Structural FormulaV.1.svg|1''H''-1,2,4-Triazole
4H-1,2,4-Triazole Structural FormulaV.1.svg|4''H''-1,2,4-Triazole
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Derivatives==
The triazole [[antifungal drug]]s include [[fluconazole]], [[isavuconazole]], [[itraconazole]], [[voriconazole]], [[pramiconazole]], [[ravuconazole]], and [[posaconazole]].

The triazole plant protection [[fungicides]] include [[epoxiconazole]], {{ill|triadimenol|de}}, [[propiconazole]], [[prothioconazole]], [[metconazole]], [[cyproconazole]], [[tebuconazole]], [[flusilazole]] and [[paclobutrazol]].

[[Paclobutrazol]], [[uniconazole]], {{ill|flutriafol|de}}, and [[triadimefon]] are used as [[Plant growth regulator|plant growth retardants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/48112/430-103_pdf.pdf|title=Using Plant Growth Regulators on Containerized Herbaceous Perennials|last=Latimer|first=Joyce|date=|website=|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Brassinazole]] is Brassinosteroid Biosynthesis Inhibitor.

[[Benzotriazole]] is used in chemical photography as a restrainer and fog suppressant.

Food, like store bought potatoes, contain retardants such as triazole or [[tetcyclacis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.4067/S0718-16202009000200013| title=Control of potato early blight with triazole fungicide using preventive and curative spraying, or a forecasting system| journal=Ciencia e Investigación Agraria| volume=36| issue=2| year=2009| last1=Mantecón| first1=Jorge D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance in chemical synthesis==
The [[azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition]] is a mild and selective reaction that gives 1,2,3-triazoles as products.  The reaction has been widely used in [[bioorthogonal chemistry]] and in organic synthesis. Triazoles are relatively stable functional groups and triazole linkages can be used in a variety of applications (for example, replacing the phosphate backbone of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroyuki Isobe et al. (2008) Triazole-Linked Analogue of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (TLDNA): Design, Synthesis, and Double-Strand Formation with Natural DNA, Org. Lett. 10 (17), pp 3729–3732.[https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ol801230k]&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''''Verbesina''''', or '''crownbeard''', is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s, in the daisy [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Asteraceae]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/358922#page/343/mode/1up Linnaeus, Carl von. 1753.  Species Plantarum 2: 901-903]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=y&gt;[http://www.tropicos.org/Name/40023779 Tropicos, ''Verbesina'' L.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a large genus of over 300 species.&lt;ref name=u&gt;[https://archive.is/20141106151059/http://dixon.iplantcollaborative.org/CompositaeWeb/default.aspx?Page=NameDetails&amp;TabNum=0&amp;NameId=57bace05-7275-4e9c-95e1-cff4b970299c Flann, C (ed) 2009+ Global Compositae Checklist ]&lt;/ref&gt;

All the species bear white or yellow flowers similar to small [[sunflower]]s. The name ''Verbesina'' very likely refers to the similarity of the foliage to that of the (unrelated) ''[[Verbena]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=134477 Flora of North America ''Verbesina'' Linnaeus]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Verbesina'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species. These include ''[[Schinia bina]]'', which has been recorded from ''[[Verbesina encelioides|V. encelioides]]'', and ''[[Schinia siren]]'' which feeds exclusively on that species.

Pollen grains from eight of the nine species of ''Verbesina'' found in Brazil have been characterized as oblate-speroidal, medium-sized, isopolar monads.  They are 3-colplorate with a subtriangular amb, a small polar area, a long colpus, a lalongate endoaperture, a caveate exine and an echinate sexine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes Moreira|first=Giselle |display-authors=etal |date=January–March 2019|title=Pollen morphology of Brazilian species of Verbesina L.

'''Banco Azteca''' is a bank which operates in Mexico, Panama, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru and El Salvador. The company's products are consumer credit for goods, personal loans, small business loans, credit cards, mortgages and payroll systems.

In March 2002, Banco Azteca was formed when [[Grupo Elektra]] received the required financial services licence. The bank began operating on October 30, 2002.

The bank was criticized in a 2007 [[BusinessWeek]] magazine article for abusing [[microcredit]] practices in Mexico due to lax [[bankruptcy]], [[consumer protection]] and [[interest rate]]s laws of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2007-12-12/the-ugly-side-of-microlending The Ugly Side of Microlending], ''[[BusinessWeek|BusinessWeek magazine]]'' , December 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150527061951/http://www.economias.com.mx/2011/07/un-vistazo-compartamos-banco.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:King Edward Parish Kirk.jpg|thumb|King Edward Parish Kirk]]
'''King Edward''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]: ''Cinn Eadar'') is a small village and parish on the north coast of [[Scotland]] in [[Buchan]] midway between [[Turriff]] and [[Banff, Scotland|Banff]].

The old church of King Edward with historic graveyard was founded around 1124 and dedicated to [[St Aidan]]. The last service in the old church was on 25 June 1848, after which services moved to new building alongside the main road.

King Edward has a disused station on the [[Banff, Macduff and Turriff Junction Railway]] part of the [[Great North of Scotland Railway]] system.

==Famous inhabitants==
Probably the best known inhabitant was [[William Guild]] who was minister at the church from 1608 to 1631. Dr Guild went on to become principal at [[King's College, Aberdeen]]. Guild street in Aberdeen is named after him.

==Etymology==
The name itself has nothing to do with any &quot;King Edward&quot;, but is a corruption of an earlier [[Scottish Gaelic]] name. The first element &quot;King&quot;, usually appears as &quot;kin&quot; in Scottish placenames, and derives from &quot;Ceann&quot; meaning a headland. The second element is less certain but may derive from &quot;Eadar&quot; (between) or &quot;cathair-thalmhainn&quot; (yarrow). 

The parish of King Edward has had approx 24 variations of the name: Kynedor (12th Century), Kynedward and Kinedart to name a few.

'''Nathan Isaevich Altman''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|Натан Исаевич Альтман}}, [[transliterated]]: ''Natan Isayevich Altman''; {{OldStyleDate| December 22|1889| December 10}} – December 12, 1970)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.007-berlin.de/de/artikel/natan_altman.htm|title=Natan Altman|website=www.007-berlin.de|access-date=2019-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Russian and [[Russian avant-garde|Soviet avant-garde]]  artist, [[Cubist]] [[Painting|painter]], [[stage designer]] and book [[illustrator]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Vinnytsia]], in the [[Podolia Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Ukraine]]) to a family of Jewish merchants.

==Career==
From 1902 to 1907, he studied painting and sculpture at the [[Grekov Odessa Art school|Art College]] in [[Odessa]] (now independent [[Ukraine]]). In 1906, he had his first exhibition in Odessa.

In 1910, he went to Paris, where he stayed for one year. He studied at the Free Russian Academy in Paris, working in the studio of [[Wladimir Baranoff-Rossine]], and had contact with [[Marc Chagall]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], and [[David Shterenberg]].

[[File:Akhmatova 1914.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Portrait of Anna Akhmatova'' (1914), Oil on canvas. In the collection of the State Russian Museum.]]
In 1912, Altman moved to [[Saint Petersburg]]. His famous ''Portrait of Anna Akhmatova'', conceived in [[Cubism|Cubist]] style, was painted in 1914. From 1915 to 1917, Nathan Altman was the teacher at Mikhail Bernstein's private art school. After 1916 he started to work as a [[stage designer]].

In 1918, he was the member of the Board for Artistic Matters within the Department of Fine Arts of the [[Narkompros|People's Commissariat of Enlightenment]] together with [[Kasimir Malevich|Malevich]], Baranoff-Rossine and Shevchenko. In the same year he had an exhibition with the group ''Jewish Society for the Furthering of the Arts'' in Moscow, together with Wladimir Baranoff-Rossine, [[El Lissitzky]] and the others. In this same year, he installed a temporary work of architectural sculpture in [[Palace Square]] to commemorate the 1st anniversary of the [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Cooke, ''Russian Avant-Garde'', Academy Editions, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The canvas was subsequently cut up and used for soldiers' foot bindings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etd.library.pitt.edu/ETD/available/etd-12072005-193438/unrestricted/SCorbesero2005.pdf The Anniversaries of the October Revolution, 1918-1927] by Susan M. Corbesero, [[University of Pittsburgh]] 2005, accessed 7 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lough Ramor''' ({{lang-gle|Loch Ramhar}}) is a large natural lake of 741 hectares situated near [[Virginia, County Cavan]]. From early records ''Vita Tripartita'' identified as being in the territory of Cenal Muinreamhair. The literal meaning of the term Muinreamhair is 'fat-neck' and appears to be derived from a prehistoric or mythical ancestor warrior, connoting great strength. Loch Muinreamhair also appears in early manuscripts of [[Annals of the Four Masters|the Four Masters]]. Lough Ramor has been designated as a proposed Natural Heritage Area (pNHA) and flows into the Blackwater which is a designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the [[Natura 2000]] wildlife [[habitat conservation]] programme (site code 002299)&lt;http://webgis.npws.ie/npwsviewer/&gt;.

==Natural environment==
Lough Ramor is a partly wooded [[wetland]] site, a haven for many species of wildlife both resident and migratory. Available recorded history indicates that nearly half of the {{convert|170|acre|km2}} of ''Deerpark'' woodland was once oak woodland, the timber being used for building and agricultural purposes. During the seventeenth century it was reported that early Virginia settlers had to transport their building timber from west Cavan and Fermanagh. The early nineteenth century saw extensive tree planting of ash, elm, oak, larch, spruce and Scots pine. In recent times additional broad leaf varieties were planted including sycamore.

The most recent site study conducted by the Government Department of the Environment describes the Lough Ramor area as a hollow in the Silurian strata that covers most of eastern County Cavan. Lough Ramor is a very shallow lake with a pH of 7.5 and a maximum depth of six metres. The water is nutritionally poor but is periodically enriched, resulting in algal blooms. Being situated on a different rock type than other Cavan lakes it differs also in appearance. Much of the shore has semi-natural woodland of alder, willows and hazel. The stands near Virginia were originally planted.

Hazel and hawthorn scrub is widespread on relatively dry sites with bramble, false brome, wood sedge, [[Viola (plant)|violet]], [[Common bluebell|bluebell]], wild hyacinth and [[Primula vulgaris|primrose]]. Where such communities occur on a rocky shore crab apple often grows with roses and dog violet. The scrub grades into woodland in several places on the southern shore and here ash and oak occur with holly. The bird community in such sites include treecreeper, long-tailed tit, chiffchaff, willow warbler and locally blackcap, woodpigeon, sparrowhawk, jay, pheasant and woodcock are also found.

The islands are mostly covered by Willows, in more open places black-headed gulls nest, mallard, teal and red-breasted merganser breed on the island, [[great crested grebe]] largely use the mainland shores of the lake.

Freshwater marshes exist in many places around the shore but extensive reed-beds stretching out into the lake are rare. The margins of the marshes are mostly sedge dominated by such species as bottle sedge, bladder-sedge, tufted-sedge, common-sedge and occasionally water-sedge, water horsetail, marsh cinquefoil and bur-reeds also occur commonly. Also on the fringes occurs a more varied community characteristic of base-poor areas, with such species as marsh ragwort, lesser spearwort, devils-bit scaboius, marsh bedstraw and hoary willowherb, creeping bent, sweet vernal-grass, Yorkshire fog and purple moor-grass. Cuckooflower occurs commonly and bog violet and greater spearwort are to be found in places.

Stretches of the shore with muddy or stony substrates provide niches for bur marigold and the scarce tasteless water-pepper and small water-pepper.

The lake supports nationally important numbers of [[cormorant]] (averaging around 200) and notable concentrations of [[whooper swan]], [[wigeon]], Teal, [[mallard]], [[grey heron]] and [[lapwing]]. [[Curlew]] and lapwing also nest in the fringing marshes.

The plant communities along the lake margins are of note and combine with over wintering bird numbers to make Lough Ramor an important wetland site.

== Early Christian settlements ==
References to an early Christian foundation in the Loch Muinreamhair area are found in the ''Martyrology of Donegal'', where the 6th of February is recorded as the festival of Saints Brandubh and Coluim of Loch Muinreamhair. There is a similar entry in the ''Felire of Gorman'' and other undated Irish Calendars. It is thought that these people flived shortly after the introduction of Christianity, during the fifth century. It is assumed that an island or [[crannog]] was used as the initial foundation for the early church in Loch Muinreamhair. One such island has the remains of medieval ecclesiastical associations, its early name is not recorded, but since the early eighteenth century it has been known locally as Woodward's Island, after a prominent [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] family who built a villa upon the island.

The medieval island church belonged to the Augustinian Abbey of St. Mary's in Ceannannus (Kells), an Anglo-Norman institution, not to be confused with the early Columban Abbey of Ceannannus that was founded by [[Saint Columcille]]. There was a local tradition that some of the early period monks who lived on the island were killed by thives who plundered the church. The Augustinians acquired the site, probably during the 13th century, after the ecclesiastical diocese boundaries were changed to include the new diocese of Kilmore in the territory then known as East Breifne.

Neither saints Brandubh or Coluin are mentioned in the ''Annals of the Four Masters''. The name Brandubh (literally interpreted as Black Raven) is mentioned as being the King of Leinster, who died in the year [[601 in Ireland|601]].

A warlike race of people called Luigni and Gailanga ruled over the Blackwater and Ramor regions, where it may be inferred that St.Patrick sent missionaries into the territory and that Saints Brandubh and Coluin were these early missionaries.

== Early civilisations ==
There is evidence of early civilisation in the Lough Ramor region dating back to 2000BC. There once stood a [[Neolithic]] [[dolmen]], or burial site, in the townland of Ballaghanea. Other stone markings dating from the period of the [[Bronze Age]] have been identified in Munterconnacht.

The island ecclesiastical site, described above, comes into prominence during 845, when the Four Masters describes the territory of the Luigni of Sliabh Guire. They were a warlike tribe introduced from the western seaboard and established during the third century, one of a chain of 'buffer states' to guard the frontiers of the kingdom of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]]. Traces ring forts of many raths, lios and ring forts abound the region. Maelseachlainn, King of Meath led an attack to exterminate a band of marauders who established a stronghold on the island. The chronicles describe the event:

''&quot;The demolition of the island of Loch Muinreamhair by Maelseachlainn, son of Maelruanaidh against a crowd of 'sons of death' of the Luigni and Gailenga who were plundering the districts at the instigation of the foreigners (Norsemen) and they were destroyed by him.&quot;''

A similar mention is entered in the [[Annals of Ulster]] given as the year [[846 in Ireland|846]]. But local tradition tells of the robbers fighting amongst themselves for a share of the spoils from various plundering raids including the island church, may be an echo down through the centuries that fierce battles did however take place upon a hillock known locally as ''Cnoc Fola'', the hill of blood.

===[[Zagat’s]]===
SNL is certainly notable, as are many, many of the sketches. But a sketch that was only done twice? In one of the show's worst seasons? That isn't in any other way notable? &lt;s&gt;[[User:128.231.88.4|128.231.88.4]]&lt;/s&gt; [[User:Aeverett|You can call me Al]] 18:58, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' to [[SNL]] -[[User:Amoffit|Andrew]] 21:27, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
**I suggest a redirect to [[Zagat Survey]] would make more sense. The link on [[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches]] will need to be addressed as well. [[User:Aeverett|You can call me Al]] 21:30, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
&lt;s&gt;*'''Weak keep'''. [[Cecil Turtle]] gets an article, and he only appeared in three cartoons, so as a recurring comedy bit in a larger body of work, I see this as (weakly) similar. —[[User:BrianSmithson|BrianSmithson]] 21:41, 31 October 2005 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt;
**Changing my vote per Leadpipevigilante's idea. '''Merge''' into [[Sketches from Saturday Night Live|Sketches from ''Saturday Night Live'']] or similar. [[User:BrianSmithson|BrianSmithson]] 12:38, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' to [[Zagat Survey]] per You can call me Al. --[[User:Metropolitan90|Metropolitan90]] 02:26, 1 November 2005 (UTC)\
*'''Merge''' with other short-lived recurring SNL sketches.  I don't think this fits with Zagat's Survey (although a mention of it in that article wouldn't be out of place).  I'm currently working on getting information together on most of the recurring sketches that appeared on SNL.  I would like to put them all into categories so there aren't all these stubs hanging around.  But it's a process, so please bear with me.  I would like any input I can get on what the categories should be.  I have two in mind so far &quot;Characters That Appeared On Weekend Update&quot; and &quot;Short-Lived Saturday Night Live Sketches&quot; (which would include anything that recurred four or fewer times).  Suggestions?  [[User:Leadpipevigilante|Leadpipevigilante]] 04:17, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
**Hmm. I thought someone had done this for ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', but that was just the characters (see [[Characters from Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Characters from ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'']]). It ''should'' be done for that show's sketches as well. I've changed my vote to merge, per your idea. [[User:BrianSmithson|BrianSmithson]] 12:38, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' to [[Zagat Survey]] per You can call me Al. [[User:Youngamerican|Youngamerican]] 14:56, 1 November 2005 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' to Leadpipevigilante's page, whatever s/he calls it in the end when it's made. ''After'' that is done, a redirect to [[Zagat's]] might be fine -- but with a disambig line o' top to this content. [[User:Jacqui M Schedler|&lt;font color=&quot;#663366&quot;&gt;Jacqui]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt; [[User_talk:Jacqui M Schedler|★&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:45, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

*'''Please retain''' the article on the SNL sketch comedy, Zagat. Perhaps, the default link can be to the article on Zagat's, the restaurant guide, with a disambiguation link to the SNL sketch article. SNL has fans from many countries and cultures, who do not always get references to American pop culture. Such articles in the Wikipedia are very useful.

'''Youth leaders''' are persons that are active in youth work field.

Youth leaders, educator or youth counsellor are not the same as [[Child and Youth Worker]] named persons in Canada and United States of America, which are therapeutics youth workers.
They are also [[Youth Workers]], or Youth Support Workers.

When acting in youth communities, they are called [[Community youth workers]].

==Training==
In several countries they take special trainings in order to be employed.

For instance for non-professional Youth Leaders:

* In UK, [[National Vocational Qualification]] or [[Vocational Qualification|Vocationally Related Qualification]], Level 2 or 3 can be required (it replaced the RAMPs training).
* In other countries like Germany or France, specific certificates can be required by the employer (&quot;JuLeiCa&quot; in Germany and &quot;BAFA&quot; in France, higher are professional graduate programs).

For professional Youth Workers, professional qualification programmes of study are offered by universities or colleges of higher education.

[[File:Kilbucho Church.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Ruins of the Church of Kilbucho]]
'''Kilbucho''' ({{lang-gd|Cille Bheagha}}) is a small settlement in the [[List of civil parishes in Scotland|parish]] of [[Broughton, Glenholm and Kilbucho]] in the [[Scottish Borders]] area of [[Scotland]] in [[Peeblesshire]] and near [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]] and [[Broughton, Scottish Borders|Broughton]].

[[File:Broughton,_Glenholm_and_Kilbucho_map.jpg|290px|left|thumb|'''Kilbucho (1821)''' &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;The parish was united with Broughton and Glenholm from 1794&lt;/small&gt;]]

The name derives from the church which was dedicated to [[St Bega]] an Irish abbess. Several monasteries were dedicated to St Bega,  many in [[Cumbria]] including [[St Bees]] but also in Scotland at Kilbagie in Clackmannanshire and Kilbegie in Argyllshire. Near the church is St Bees well&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Baird ''Annals of  Tweedale Parish'' John Smith &amp; Son Glasgow 1924&lt;/ref&gt;

The former parish of Kilbucho, now united in Broughton, Glenholm and Kilbucho, has an area of 6,710 acres. &lt;ref name=tweeddale&gt;Description of Tweeddale, by Alexander Pennecuik, publ A. Allardice, Leith, 1815; p.43&lt;/ref&gt; It forms a valley between Cardon Hill on the south and Hartree Hills on the north, however the land is mainly level with a very slight inclination towards Biggar Water. &lt;ref name=histPeeb&gt;History of Peeblesshire,  by William Chambers, publ. William And Robert Chambers,  Edinburgh and London, Ι864; p.443&lt;/ref&gt;
Kilbucho is &quot;fenced&quot; in by hills on three sides, including some of the highest in southern Scotland east of [[Galloway]]. [[Coulter Fell]] is near here.

The manors of Kilbucho and Thriepland are mentioned in writs of 13th century. &lt;ref name=histPeeb/&gt;

The area is strongly connected with [[John Buchan]], the author of ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps|The Thirty Nine Steps]]'' and former governor general of [[Canada]]. It is thought that the inspiration for his 1927 novel ''[[Witch Wood]]'' comes from this particular area.

'''KARJ''' (92.1 [[Hertz|MHz]]) is a radio station serving the [[North County (San Diego area)|North County]] of [[San Diego County, California]] airing a [[Contemporary worship music|Worship music]] format from the [[Air1]] network, and is owned by the [[Educational Media Foundation]].

KARJ's [[transmitter]] and [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] are located at {{coord|33|6|39|N|117|9|13|W}} in [[Escondido, California]] near Frank's Peak on [[Mount Whitney]]. The station broadcasts with 580 [[watt]]s of [[effective radiated power]] (ERP).

== History ==
This station began program testing in 1966, However, it didn't sign on until August 1978, when it became KOWN-FM.
In 1987, it became KWNQ, later becoming KOWF-FM, At this point, the station broadcast country music from local studios in Escondido.

The callsign was changed [[KFSD]] while owned by the [[Astor Broadcast Group]], who chose a [[radio format|format]] of [[classical music]] acquired from Lotus Communications in [[1997 in radio|1997]], which in [[2001 in radio|2001]] switched to an [[alternative rock]] format as ''Premium 92/1'', still with the KFSD call letters.

In 2003, [[KFSD|KFSD-FM]] was purchased by [[Lincoln Financial Media|Jefferson Pilot Communications]] and turned into KSOQ-FM, the simulcasting partner for their popular [[country music]] station [[KWFN|KSON-FM]], which faced geographical challenges to its signal's penetration into the [[San Diego North County, California|North County]] area of [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] as well as into southern [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], problems largely solved by the addition of KSOQ.

On December 8, 2014, [[Entercom]] announced that it will purchase [[Lincoln Financial Group]]'s entire 15-station lineup (including KSOQ) in a $106.5 million deal, and would operate the outlets under a LMA deal until the sale was approved by the FCC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/91146/entercom-acquires-lincoln-financial-media/#comment-19809 &quot;Entercom Acquires Lincoln Financial Media&quot;] from Radio Insight (December 8, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was consummated on July 17, 2015.

On September 26, 2017, Entercom announced a divestment of three stations (KSOQ, [[WGGY|WGGI]], and [[KKLQ (FM)|KSWD]]) to the [[Educational Media Foundation]] as part of its merger with [[CBS Radio]] (which locally owned [[KSON (FM)|KEGY]] and [[KYXY]]) to comply with FCC ownership rules in the San Diego market; the FCC approved the sale of all three stations on November 2. Upon the closing of the acquisition on November 16, EMF flipped the station to its then [[Contemporary Christian]] [[Air 1]] network at 1:00pm that day, at exactly the same time as [[KKLQ (FM)|KSWD]]'s switch to CCM programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/119937/entercom-divests-100-3-sound-los-angeles-two-others-educational-media-foundation/|title=Entercom Divests 100.3 The Sound Los Angeles &amp; Two Others to Educational Media Foundation|publisher=RadioInsight|first=Lance|last=Venta|date=September 27, 2017|access-date=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMF also changed the station's call letters to '''KYDQ''', the callsign is similar to repeater station [[KYDO]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fcc-ksoqtokydq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Bureau Call Sign Actions|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1115/DOC-347768A1.pdf|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=November 15, 2017|format=PDF|date=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station adopted its current format at midnight on January 1, 2019 when the whole Air 1 network shifted to worship music.  On April 11, 2019, this station changed its callsign to '''KARJ''', the new callsign resembles &quot;Air1&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fccdata.org/?lang=en&amp;facid=49206|title=Query the REC California Network database for KARJ|publisher=REC Group|access-date=20 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the second time EMF had changed the callsign, the first being when EMF took control in 2017.

==HD Programming==
Under its previous owner, an HD Radio transmitter was fitted to the station. The HD1 channel is the digitized standard signal as required by law. The current HD channels are listed below
*'''HD2''': [[K-Love Classics]]
*'''HD3''': [[KMRO]] simulcast

*This article currently qualifies for [[WP:CSD]]. Firstly, it is a copyright violation so is eligible under A8. Secondly, what isn't copyvio is A1 a short, meaningless article with little or no context namely: &quot;This is a song about a very big, strong, black, sexy southern baptist minister Who thinks he's got his program all together, until he meets a lady who lets him know That he ain't got it all together, his name is reverend dr. lee&quot;. A Google showed it was a song by [[Natalie Cole]] . This song has not charted so its notability is questionable and this article is a clear speedy candidate.

The '''[[Coat of Arms of Argentina]]''' was established in its current form in [[1944]].  At the top is the famous sun symbol of Argentina, that is also found on the [[Flag of Argentina]].  The sun symbolizes the rising of Argentina, and that is why it is in the rising position. The shaking hands symbolize the union of the provinces wanting to protect their freedom (Phrygian cap).
